        The late Dr. Georg B&uuml;hler's essay <i>Ueber die Indische Secte der
        Jaina</i>, read at the anniversary meeting of the Imperial Academy of
        Sciences of Vienna on the 26th May 1887, has been for some time out of
        print in the separate form. Its value as a succinct account of the
        &#346;r&acirc;vaka sect, by a scholar conversant with them and their
        religious literature is well known to European scholars; but to nearly
        all educated natives of India works published in German and other
        continental languages are practically sealed books, and thus the fresh
        information which they are well able to contribute is not elicited. It
        is hoped that the translation of this small work may meet with their
        acceptance and that of Europeans in India and elsewhere to whom the
        original is either unknown or who do not find a foreign language so easy
        to read as their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The translation has been prepared under my supervision, and with a few
        short footnotes. Professor B&uuml;hler's long note on the authenticity
        of the Jaina tradition I have transferred to an appendix (p. 48)
        incorporating with it a summary of what he subsequently expanded in
        proof of his thesis.

      <p>
        To Colebrooke's account of the Tirtham[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->karas reverenced by the Jainas, but little has been
        added since its publication in the ninth volume of the <i>Asiatic
        Researches</i>; and as these are the centre of their worship, always
        represented in their temples, and surrounded by attendant figures,--I
        have ventured to add a somewhat fuller account of them and a summary of
        the general mythology of the sect, which may be useful to the
        archaeologist and the student of their iconography.

        THE INDIAN SECT OF THE JAINAS.

      <p>
        The <i>Jaina</i> sect is a religious society of modern India, at
        variance to Brahmanism, and possesses undoubted claims on the interest
        of all friends of Indian history. This claim is based partly on the
        peculiarities of their doctrines and customs, which present several
        resemblances to those of Buddhism, but, above all, on the fact that it
        was founded in the same period as the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Larger and smaller communities of <i>Jainas</i> or <i>Arhata</i>,--that
        is followers of the prophet, who is generally called simply the <i>Jina</i>--'the
        conqueror of the world',--or the <i>Arhat</i>--'the holy one',--are to
        be found in almost every important Indian town, particularly among the
        merchant class. In some provinces of the West and North-west, in Gujar&acirc;t,
        R&acirc;jput&acirc;na, and the Panj&acirc;b, as also in the Dravidian
        districts in the south,--especially in Kanara,--they are numerous; and,
        owing to the influence of their wealth, they take a prominent place.
        They do not, however, present a compact mass, but are divided into two
        rival branches--the <i>Digambara</i> and <i>&#346;vet&acirc;mbara</i>[<a
        href="#b1_fn1" id="b1_fm1">1</a>] --each of which is split up into
        several subdivisions. The Digambara, that is, "those whose robe is the
        atmosphere," owe their name to the circumstance that they regard
        absolute nudity as the indispensable sign of holiness, [<a href="#b1_fn2"
        id="b1_fm2">2</a>] --though the advance of civilization has compelled
        them to depart from the practice of their theory. The &#346;vet&acirc;mbara,
        that is, "they who are clothed in white"--do not claim this doctrine,
        but hold it as possible that the holy ones, who clothe themselves, may
        also attain the highest goal. They allow, however, that the founder of
        the Jaina religion and his first disciples disdained to wear clothes.
        They are divided, not only by this quarrel, but also by differences
        about dogmas and by a different literature. The separation must
        therefore be of old standing. Tradition, too, upholds this--though the
        dates given do not coincide. From inscriptions it is certain that the
        split occurred before the first century of our era. [<a href="#b1_fn3"
        id="b1_fm3">3</a>] Their opposing opinions are manifested in the fact
        that they do not allow each other the right of intermarriage or of
        eating at the same table,--the two chief marks of social equality. In
        spite of the age of the schism, and the enmity that divides the two
        branches, they are at one as regards the arrangement of their
        communities, doctrine, discipline, and cult,--at least in the more
        important points; and, thus, one can always speak of the Jaina religion
        as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The characteristic feature of this religion is its claim to
        universality, which it holds in common with Buddhism, and in opposition
        to Brahmanism. It also declares its object to be to lead all men to
        salvation, and to open its arms--not only to the noble Aryan, but also
        to the low-born &#346;&ucirc;dra and even to the alien, deeply despised
        in India, the Mlechcha. [<a href="#b1_fn4" id="b1_fm4">4</a>] As their
        doctrine, like Buddha's, is originally a philosophical ethical system
        intended for ascetics, the disciples, like the Buddhists, are, divided
        into ecclesiastics and laity. At the head stands an order of ascetics,
        originally Nirgrantha "they, who are freed from all bands," now usually
        called Yatis--"Ascetics", or S&acirc;dhus--"Holy", which, among the
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbara also admits women, [<a href="#b1_fn5" id="b1_fm5">5</a>]
        and under them the general community of the Up&acirc;saka "the
        Worshippers", or the &#346;r&acirc;vaka, "the hearers".
      </p>
      <p>
        The ascetics alone are able to penetrate into the truths which Jina
        teaches, to follow his rules and to attain to the highest reward which
        he promises. The laity, however, who do not dedicate themselves to the
        search after truth, and cannot renounce the life of the world, still
        find a refuge in Jainism. It is allowed to them as hearers to share its
        principles, and to undertake duties, which are a faint copy of the
        demands made on the ascetics. Their reward is naturally less. He who
        remains in the world cannot reach the highest goal, but he can still
        tread the way which leads to it. Like all religions of the Hind&ucirc;s
        founded on philosophical speculation, Jainism sees this highest goal in
        <i>Nirv&acirc;na</i> or <i>Moksha</i>, the setting free of the
        individual from the <i>Sam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over m -->s&acirc;ra</i>,--the revolution of birth and death.
        The means of reaching it are to it, as to Buddhism, the three
        Jewels--the right Faith, the right Knowledge, and the right Walk. By the
        right Faith it understands the full surrender of himself to the teacher,
        the Jina, the firm conviction that he alone has found the way of
        salvation, and only with him is protection and refuge to be found. Ask
        who Jina is, and the Jaina will give exactly the same answer as the
        Buddhist with respect to Buddha. He is originally an erring man, bound
        with the bonds of the world, who,--not by the help of a teacher, nor by
        the revelation of the Vedas--which, he declares, are corrupt--but by his
        own power, has attained to omniscience and freedom, and out of pity for
        suffering mankind preaches and declares the way of salvation, which he
        has found. Because he has conquered the world and the enemies in the
        human heart, he is called Jina "the Victor", Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, "the
        great hero"; because he possesses the highest knowledge, he is called
        Sarvaj&ntilde;a or Kevalin, the "omniscient", Buddha, the "enlightened";
        because he has freed himself from the world he receives the names of
        Mukta "the delivered one", Siddha and Tath&acirc;gata, "the perfected",
        Arhat "the holy one"; and as the proclaimer of the doctrine, he is the T&icirc;rthakara
        "the finder of the ford", through the ocean of the <i>Sam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over m -->s&acirc;ra</i>. In these epithets, applied to the
        founder of their doctrine, the Jainas agree almost entirely with the
        Buddhists, as the likeness of his character to that of Buddha would lead
        us to expect. They prefer, however, to use the names Jina and Arhat,
        while the Buddhists prefer to speak of Buddha as Tath&acirc;gata or
        Sugata. The title T&icirc;rthakara is peculiar to the Jainas. Among the
        Buddhists it is a designation for false teachers. [<a href="#b1_fn6"
        id="b1_fm6">6</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jaina says further, however, that there was more than one Jina. Four
        and twenty have, at long intervals, appeared and have again and again
        restored to their original purity the doctrines darkened by evil
        influences. They all spring from noble, warlike tribes. Only in such,
        not among the low Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s, can a Jina see the light of the
        world. The first Jina R
        <!-- dot under R -->&#305;shabha,--more than 100 billion oceans of years
        ago,--periods of unimaginable length, [<a href="#b1_fn7" id="b1_fm7">7</a>]
        --was born as the son of a king of Ayodhy&acirc; and lived eight million
        four hundred thousand years. The intervals between his successors and
        the durations of their lives became shorter and shorter. Between the
        twenty third, P&acirc;r&#347;va and the twenty fourth Vardham&acirc;na,
        were only 250 years, and the age of the latter is given as only
        seventy-two years. He appeared, according to some, in the last half of
        the sixth century, according to others in the first half of the fifth
        century B.C. He is of course the true, historical prophet of the Jainas
        and it is in his doctrine, that the Jainas should believe. The dating
        back of the origin of the Jaina religion again, agrees with the
        pretensions of the Buddhists, who recognise twenty-five Buddhas who
        taught the same system one after the other. Even with Brahmanism, it
        seems to be in some distant manner connected, for the latter teaches in
        its cosmogony, the successive appearance of Demiurges, and wise men--the
        fourteen Manus, who, at various periods helped to complete the work of
        creation and proclaimed the Brahmanical law. These Brahmanical ideas may
        possibly have given rise to the doctrines of the twenty-five Buddhas and
        twenty-four Jinas, [<a href="#b1_fn8" id="b1_fm8">8</a>] which,
        certainly, are later additions in both systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The undoubted and absolutely correct comprehension of the nine truths
        which the Jina gives expression to, or of the philosophical system which
        the Jina taught, represents the second Jewel--the true Knowledge. Its
        principal features are shortly as follows. [<a href="#b1_fn9" id="b1_fm9">9</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The world (by which we are to understand, not only the visible, but also
        imaginary continents depicted with the most extravagant fancy, heavens
        and hells of the Brahmanical Cosmology, extended by new discoveries) is
        uncreated. It exists, without ruler, only by the power of its elements,
        and is everlasting. The elements of the world are six substances--souls,
        <i>Dharma</i> or moral merit, <i>Adharma</i> or sin, space, time,
        particles of matter. From the union of the latter spring four
        elements--earth, fire, water, wind--and further, bodies and all other
        appearances of the world of sense and of the supernatural worlds. The
        forms of the appearances are mostly unchangeable. Only the bodies of men
        and their age increase or decrease in consequence of the greater or less
        influence of sin or merit, during immeasurably long periods,--the <i>Avasarpin
        <!-- dot under n -->i</i> and the <i>Utsarpin
        <!-- dot under n -->i</i>. Souls are, each by itself, independent, real
        existences whose foundation is pure intelligence, and who possess an
        impulse to action. In the world they are always chained to bodies. The
        reason of this confinement is that they give themselves up to the stress
        of activity, to passions, to influences of the senses and objects of the
        mind, or attach themselves to a false belief. The deeds which they
        perform in the bodies are <i>Karman</i>, merit and sin. This drives
        them--when one body has passed away, according to the conditions of its
        existence--into another, whose quality depends on the character of the
        <i>Karman</i>, and will be determined especially by the last thoughts
        springing from it before death. Virtue leads to the heavens of the gods
        or to birth among men in pure and noble races. Sin consigns the souls to
        the lower regions, in the bodies of animals, in plants, even into masses
        of lifeless matter. For--according to the Jaina doctrine--souls exist
        not only in organic structures, but also in apparently dead masses, in
        stones, in lumps of earth, in drops of water, in fire and in wind.
        Through union with bodies the nature of the soul is affected. In the
        mass of matter the light of its intelligence is completely concealed; it
        loses consciousness, is immovable, and large or small, according to the
        dimensions of its abode. In organic structures it is always conscious;
        it depends however, on the nature of the same, whether it is movable or
        immovable and possessed of five, four, three, two, or one organ of
        sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bondage of souls, if they inhabit a human body, can be abolished by
        the suppression of the causes which lead to their confinement and by the
        destruction of the <i>Karman</i>. The suppression of the causes is
        accomplished by overcoming the inclination to be active and the
        passions, by the control of the senses, and by steadfastly holding to
        the right faith. In this way will be hindered the addition of new <i>Karman</i>,
        new merit or new guilt. The destruction of <i>Karman</i> remaining from
        previous existences can be brought about either spontaneously by the
        exhaustion of the supply or by asceticism. In the latter case the final
        state is the attainment to a knowledge which penetrates the universe, to
        <i>Kevala, J&ntilde;&acirc;na</i> and <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i> or <i>Moksha</i>: full deliverance from all
        bonds. These goals may be reached even while the soul is still in its
        body. If however the body is destroyed then the soul wanders into the
        "No-World" <i>(al&ocirc;ka)</i> as the Jain says, i.e. into the heaven
        of Jina 'the delivered', lying outside the world. [<a href="#b1_fn10"
        id="b1_fm10">10</a>] There it continues eternally in its pure
        intellectual nature. Its condition is that of perfect rest which nothing
        disturbs. These fundamental ideas are carried out in the particulars
        with a subtilness and fantasy unexampled, even in subtile and fantastic
        India, in a scholarly style, and defended by the <i>sy&acirc;dv&acirc;da</i>--the
        doctrine of "It may be so",--a mode of reasoning which makes it possible
        to assert and deny the existence of one and the same thing. If this be
        compared with the other Indian systems, it stands nearer the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>
        than the Buddhist, with which it has the acceptance in common of only
        four, not five elements. Jainism touches all the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>
        religions and Buddhism in its cosmology and ideas of periods, and it
        agrees entirely with regard to the doctrines of <i>Karman</i>, of the
        bondage, and the deliverance of souls. Atheism, the view that the world
        was not created, is common to it with Buddhism and the S&acirc;m[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->khya philosophy. Its psychology approaches that of
        the latter in that both believe in the existence of innumerable
        independent souls. But the doctrine of the activity of souls and their
        distribution into masses of matter is in accordance with the Ved&acirc;nta,
        according to which the principle of the soul penetrates every thing
        existing. In the further development of the soul doctrine, the
        conceptions 'individual soul' and 'living being' to which the Jaina and
        the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i> give the same name,--<i>j&icirc;va</i>, seem to
        become confounded. The Jaina idea of space and time as real substances
        is also found in the Vai&#347;eshika system. In placing <i>Dharma</i>
        and <i>Adharma</i> among substances Jainism stands alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third jewel, the right Walk which the Jaina ethics contains, has its
        kernel in the five great oaths which the Jaina ascetic takes on his
        entrance into the order. He promises, just as the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>
        penitent, and almost in the same words, not to hurt, not to speak
        untruth, to appropriate nothing to himself without permission, to
        preserve chastity, and to practice self-sacrifice. The contents of these
        simple rules become most extraordinarily extended on the part of the
        Jainas by the insertion of five clauses, in each of which are three
        separate active instruments of sin, in special relation to thoughts,
        words, and deeds. Thus, concerning the oath not to hurt, on which the
        Jaina lays the greatest emphasis: it includes not only the intentional
        killing or hurting of living beings, plants, or the souls existing in
        dead matter, it requires also the utmost carefulness in the whole manner
        of life, in all movements, a watchfulness over all functions of the body
        by which anything living might be hurt. [<a href="#b1_fn11" id="b1_fm11">11</a>]
        It demands finally strict watch over the heart and tongue, and the
        avoidance of all thoughts and words which might lead to dispute and
        quarrel and thereby to harm. In like manner the rule of sacrifice means
        not only that the ascetic has no house or possessions, it teaches also
        that a complete unconcern toward agreeable and disagreeable impressions
        is necessary, as also the sacrifice of every attachment to anything
        living or dead. [<a href="#b1_fn12" id="b1_fm12">12</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside the conscientious observance of these rules, Tapas--Asceticism,
        is most important for the right walk of those, who strive to attain <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>. Asceticism is inward as well as outward. The
        former is concerned with self-discipline, the cleansing and purifying of
        the mind. It embraces repentance of sin, confession of the same to the
        teacher, and penance done for it, humility before teachers and all
        virtuous ones, and the service of the same, the study and teaching of
        the faith or holy writing, pious meditations on the misery of the world,
        the impurity of the body, etc. and lastly, the stripping off of every
        thing pertaining to the world. On the other hand, under the head of
        exterior Asceticism, the Jaina understands temperance, begging, giving
        up all savoury food, different kinds of self-mortification such as
        sitting in unnatural and wearying positions, hindering the action of the
        organs, especially by fasts, which, under certain circumstances may be
        continued to starvation. Voluntary death by the withdrawal of
        nourishment is, according to the strict doctrine of the Digambara,
        necessary for all ascetics, who have reached the highest step of
        knowledge. The Kevalin, they say, eats no longer. The milder &#346;vet&acirc;mbara
        do not demand this absolutely, but regard it, as a sure entrance to <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>. In order, however, that this death may bear
        its fruits, the ascetic must keep closely to the directions for it,
        otherwise he merely lengthens the number of rebirths. [<a href="#b1_fn13"
        id="b1_fm13">13</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        From these general rules follow numerous special ones, regarding the
        life of the disciple of Jina. The duty of sacrifice forces him, on
        entrance into the order, to give up his possessions and wander homeless
        in strange lands, alms-vessel in hand, and, if no other duty interferes,
        never to stay longer than one night in the same place. The rule of
        wounding nothing means that he must carry three articles with him, a
        straining cloth, for his drinking water, a broom, and a veil before his
        mouth, in order to avoid killing insects. It also commands him to avoid
        all cleansing and washing, and to rest in the four months of the rainy
        season, in which animal and plant life displays itself most abundantly.
        In order to practice asceticism, it is the rule to make this time of
        rest a period of strictest fasts, most diligent study of the holy
        writings, and deepest meditation. This duty also necessitates the
        ascetic to pluck out in the most painful manner his hair which,
        according to oriental custom, he must do away with at his
        consecration--a peculiar custom of the Jainas, which is not found among
        other penitents of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the five great vows, most of the special directions for the
        discipline of the Jain ascetic are copies, and often exaggerated copies,
        of the Br&acirc;hmanic rules for penitents. The outward marks of the
        order closely resemble those of the Sanny&acirc;sin. The life of
        wandering during eight months and the rest during the rainy season agree
        exactly; and in many other points, for example in the use of confession,
        they agree with the Buddhists. They agree with Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s
        alone in ascetic self-torture, which Buddhism rejects; and specially
        characteristic is the fact that ancient Br&acirc;hmanism recommends
        starvation to its penitents as beneficial. [<a href="#b1_fn14"
        id="b1_fm14">14</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctrine of the right way for the Jaina laity differs from that for
        the ascetics. In place of the five great vows appear mere echoes. He
        vows to avoid only serious injury to living beings, i.e. men and
        animals; only the grosser forms of untruth--direct lies; only the most
        flagrant forms of taking, what is not given, that is, theft and robbery.
        In place of the oath of chastity there is that of conjugal fidelity. In
        place of that of self-denial, the promise is not greedily to accumulate
        possessions and to be contented. To these copies are added seven other
        vows, the miscellaneous contents of which correspond to the special
        directions for the discipline of ascetics. Their object is, partly to
        bring the outward life of the laity into accordance with the Jaina
        teaching, especially with regard to the protection of living creatures
        from harm, and partly to point the heart to the highest goal. Some
        contain prohibitions against certain drinks, such as spirits; or meats,
        such as flesh, fresh butter, honey, which cannot be enjoyed without
        breaking the vow of preservation of animal life. Others limit the choice
        of businesses which the laity may enter; for example, agriculture is
        forbidden, as it involves the tearing up of the ground and the death of
        many animals, as Br&acirc;hmanism also holds. Others have to do with
        mercy and charitableness, with the preserving of inward peace, or with
        the necessity of neither clinging too much to life and its joys nor
        longing for death as the end of suffering. To the laity, however,
        voluntary starvation is also recommended as meritorious. These
        directions (as might be expected from the likeness of the circumstances)
        resemble in many points the Buddhist directions for the laity, and
        indeed are often identical with regard to the language used. Much is
        however specially in accordance with Br&acirc;hmanic doctrines. [<a
        href="#b1_fn15" id="b1_fm15">15</a>] In practical life Jainism makes of
        its laity earnest men who exhibit a stronger trait of resignation than
        other Indians and excel in an exceptional willingness to sacrifice
        anything for their religion. It makes them also fanatics for the
        protection of animal life. Wherever they gain influence, there is an end
        of bloody sacrifices and of slaughtering and killing the larger animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The union of the laity with the order of ascetics has, naturally,
        exercised a powerful reaction on the former and its development, as well
        as on its teaching, and is followed by similar results in Jainism and
        Buddhism. Then, as regards the changes in the teaching, it is no doubt
        to be ascribed to the influence of the laity that the atheistic Jaina
        system, as well as the Buddhist, has been endowed with a cult. The
        ascetic, in his striving for <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, endeavours to suppress the natural desire of
        man to worship higher powers. In the worldly hearer, who does not strive
        after this goal exclusively, this could not succeed. Since the doctrine
        gave no other support, the religious feeling of the laity clung to the
        founder of it: Jina, and with him his mythical predecessors, became
        gods. Monuments and temples ornamented with their statues were built,
        especially at those places, where the prophets, according to legends,
        had reached their goal. To this is added a kind of worship, consisting
        of offerings of flowers and incense to Jina, of adoration by songs of
        praise in celebration of their entrance into <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, of which the Jaina makes a great festival by
        solemn processions and pilgrimages to the places where it has been
        attained. [<a href="#b1_fn16" id="b1_fm16">16</a>] This influence of the
        laity has become, in course of time, of great importance to Indian art,
        and India is indebted to it for a number of its most beautiful
        architectural monuments, such as the splendid temples of &Acirc;bu, Girn&acirc;r
        and &#346;atru&ntilde;jaya in Gujar&acirc;t. It has also brought about a
        change in the mind of the ascetics. In many of their hymns in honour of
        Jina, they appeal to him with as much fervour as the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>
        to his gods; and there are often expressions in them, contrary, to the
        original teaching, ascribing to Jina a creative power. Indeed a Jaina
        description of the six principal systems goes so far as to number
        Jainism--as also Buddhism--among the theistic religions. [<a
        href="#b1_fn17" id="b1_fm17">17</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        But in other respects also the admission of the laity has produced
        decisive changes in the life of the clergy. In the education of worldly
        communities, the ascetic--whose rules of indifference toward all and
        every thing, make him a being concentrated entirely upon himself and his
        goal--is united again to humanity and its interests. The duty of
        educating the layman and watching over his life, must of necessity
        change the wandering penitents into settled monks--who dedicate
        themselves to the care of souls, missionary activity, and the
        acquisition of knowledge, and who only now and again fulfil the duty of
        changing their place of residence. The needs of the lay communities
        required the continual presence of teachers. Even should these desire to
        change from time to time, it was yet necessary to provide a shelter for
        them. Thus the Up&acirc;&#347;raya or places of refuge, the Jaina
        monasteries came into existence, which exactly correspond to the
        Buddhist Sangh&acirc;r&acirc;ma. With the monasteries and the fixed
        residence in them appeared a fixed membership of the order, which, on
        account of the Jaina principle of unconditional obedience toward the
        teacher, proved to be much stricter than in Buddhism. On the development
        of the order and the leisure of monastic life, there followed further,
        the commencement of a literary and scientific activity. The oldest
        attempt, in this respect, limited itself to bringing their doctrine into
        fixed forms. Their results were, besides other lost works, the so-called
        <i>Am[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->ga</i>,--the members of the body of the law, which
        was perhaps originally produced in the third century B.C. Of the <i>Am[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->ga</i> eleven are no doubt preserved among the &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras
        from a late edition of the fifth or sixth century A.D. These works are
        not written in Sanskrit, but in a popular Pr&acirc;krit dialect: for the
        Jina, like Buddha, used the language of the people when teaching. They
        contain partly legends about the prophet and his activity as a teacher,
        partly fragments of a doctrine or attempts at systematic representations
        of the same. Though the dialect is different they present, in the form
        of the tales and in the manner of expression, a wonderful resemblance to
        the sacred writings of the Buddhists. [<a href="#b1_fn18" id="b1_fm18">18</a>]
        The Digambaras, on the other hand, have preserved nothing of the <i>Am[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->ga</i> but the names. They put in their place later
        systematic works, also in Pr&acirc;krit, and assert, in vindication of
        their different teaching, that the canon of their rivals is corrupted.
        In the further course of history, however, both branches of the Jainas
        have, like the Buddhists, in their continual battles with the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s,
        found it necessary to make themselves acquainted with the ancient
        language of the culture of the latter. First the Digambara and later the
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbara began to use Sanskrit. They did not rest content
        with explaining their own teaching in Sanskrit works: they turned also
        to the secular sciences of the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s. They have
        accomplished so much of importance, in grammar, in astronomy, as well as
        in some branches of letters, that they have won respect even from their
        enemies, and some of their works are still of importance to European
        science. In southern India, where they worked among the Dravi<i>d</i>ian
        tribes, they also advanced the development of these languages. The
        Kanarese literary language and the Tamil and Telugu rest on the
        foundations laid by the Jaina monks. This activity led them, indeed, far
        from their proper goal, but it created for them an important position in
        the history of literature and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resemblance between the Jainas and the Buddhists, which I have had
        so often cause to bring forward, suggests the question, whether they are
        to be regarded as a branch of the latter, or whether they resemble the
        Buddhists merely because, as their tradition asserts, [<a href="#b1_fn19"
        id="b1_fm19">19</a>] they sprang from the same period and the same
        religious movement in opposition to Br&acirc;hmanism. This question, was
        formerly, and is still sometimes, answered in agreement with the first
        theory, pointing out the undoubted defects in it, to justify the
        rejection of the Jaina tradition, and even declaring it to be a late and
        intentional fabrication. In spite of this the second explanation is the
        right one, because the Buddhists themselves confirm the statements of
        the Jainas about their prophet. Old historical traditions and
        inscriptions prove the independent existence of the sect of the Jainas
        even during the first five centuries after Buddha's death, and among the
        inscriptions are some which clear the Jaina tradition not only from the
        suspicion of fraud but bear powerful witness to its honesty. [<a
        href="#b1_fn20" id="b1_fm20">20</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The oldest canonical books of the Jaina, apart from some mythological
        additions and evident exaggerations, contain the following important
        notes on the life of their last prophet. [<a href="#b1_fn21" id="b1_fm21">21</a>]
        Vardham&acirc;na was the younger son of Siddh&acirc;rtha a nobleman who
        belonged to the Kshatriya race, called in Sanskrit J&ntilde;&acirc;ti or
        J&ntilde;&acirc;ta, in Prakrit N&acirc;ya, and, according to the old
        custom of the Indian warrior caste, bore the name of a Br&acirc;hmanic
        family the K&acirc;&#347;yapa. His mother, who was called Tri&#347;al&acirc;,
        belonged to the family of the governors of Videha. Siddh&acirc;rtha's
        residence was Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>apura, the Basukund of to-day, a suburb
        of the wealthy town of Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;, the modern Besarh, in
        Videha or Tirhut. [<a href="#b1_fn22" id="b1_fm22">22</a>] Siddh&acirc;rtha
        was son-in-law to the king of Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;. Thirty years, it
        seems, Vardham&acirc;na led a worldly life in his parents' house. He
        married, and his wife Ya&#347;od&acirc; bore him a daughter Anojj&acirc;,
        who was married to a noble of the name of Jam&acirc;li, and in her turn
        had a daughter. In his thirty-first year his parents died. As they were
        followers of P&acirc;r&#347;va the twenty-third Jina, they chose,
        according to the custom of the Jainas, the death of the wise by
        starvation. Immediately after this Vardham&acirc;na determined to
        renounce the world. He got permission to take this step from his elder
        brother Nandivardhana, and the ruler of his land divided his possessions
        and became a homeless ascetic. He wandered more than twelve years, only
        resting during the rainy season, in the lands of the L&acirc;<i>d</i>ha,
        in Vajjabh&ucirc;mi and Subbhabh&ucirc;mi, the R&acirc;rh of to-day in
        Bengal, and learned to bear with equanimity great hardships and cruel
        ill treatment at the hands of the inhabitants of those districts.
        Besides these he imposed upon himself the severest mortifications; after
        the first year he discarded clothes and devoted himself to the deepest
        meditation. In the thirteenth year of this wandering life he believed he
        had attained to the highest knowledge and to the dignity of a holy one.
        He then appeared as a prophet, taught the Nirgrantha doctrine, a
        modification of the religion of P&acirc;r&#347;va, and organised the
        order of the Nirgrantha ascetics. From that time he bore the name of the
        venerable ascetic Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra. His career as a teacher lasted
        not quite thirty years, during which he travelled about, as formerly,
        all over the country, except during the rainy seasons. He won for
        himself numerous followers, both of the clergy and the lay class, among
        whom, however, in the fourteenth year of his period of teaching, a split
        arose--caused by his son-in-law Jam&acirc;li.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extent of his sphere of influence almost corresponds with that of
        the kingdoms of Sr&acirc;vast&icirc; or Kosala, Vidcha, Magadha, and
        Am[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->ga,--the modern Oudh, and the provinces of Tirhut and
        Bih&acirc;r in Western Bengal. Very frequently he spent the rainy season
        in his native place Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc; and in R&acirc;jagr
        <!-- dot under r -->iha. Among his contemporaries were, a rival teacher
        Gos&acirc;la the son of Mam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over m -->khali--whom he defeated in a dispute, the King of
        Videha--Bhambhas&acirc;ra or Bibbhis&acirc;ra called Sre<i>n</i>ika, and
        his sons Abhayakum&acirc;ra and the parricide Aj&aacute;ta&#347;atru or
        K&ucirc;<i>n</i>ika, who protected him or accepted his doctrine, and
        also the nobles of the Lichchhavi and Mallaki races. The town of P&acirc;p&acirc;
        or P&acirc;v&acirc;, the modern Padraona [<a href="#b1_fn23" id="b1_fm23">23</a>]
        is given as the place of his death, where he dwelt during the rainy
        season of the last year of his life, in the house of the scribe of king
        Hastip&acirc;la. Immediately after his death, a second split took place
        in his community. [<a href="#b1_fn24" id="b1_fm24">24</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        On consideration of this information, it immediately strikes one, that
        the scene of Vardham&acirc;na's activity is laid in the same part of
        India as Buddha laboured in, and that several of the personalities which
        play a part in the history of Buddha also appear in the Jaina legend. It
        is through the kingdoms of Kosala, Videha and Magadha, that Buddha is
        said to have wandered preaching, and their capitals &#346;r&acirc;vast&icirc;
        and R&acirc;jagr
        <!-- dot under r -->iha are just the places named, where he founded the
        largest communities. It is also told of the inhabitants of Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;
        that many turned to his doctrine. Many legends are told of his
        intercourse and friendship with Bimbis&acirc;ra or &#346;re<i>n</i>ika,
        king of Videha, also of the murder of the latter by his son Aj&acirc;ta&#347;atru,
        who, tortured with remorse, afterwards approached Buddha; mention is
        also made of his brother Abhayakum&acirc;ra, likewise Makkhali Gos&acirc;la
        is mentioned among Buddha's opponents and rivals. It is thus clear that
        the oldest Jaina legend makes Vardham&acirc;na a fellow countryman and
        contemporary of Buddha, and search might be suggested in the writings of
        the Buddhists for confirmation of these assumptions. Such indeed are to
        be found in no small number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the oldest works of the Singalese Canon,--which date apparently
        from the beginning of the second century after Buddha's death, or the
        fourth century B.C., and which at any rate had their final edition in
        the third,--frequently mention an opposing sect of ascetics, the Nigan
        <!-- dot under n --><i>t</i>ha, which the northern texts, written in
        Sanskrit, recognise among the opponents of Buddha, under the name
        Nirgrantha, whom an old <i>S&ucirc;tra</i> [<a href="#b1_fn25"
        id="b1_fm25">25</a>] describes as "heads of companies of disciples and
        students, teachers of students, well known, renowned, founders of
        schools of doctrine, esteemed as good men by the multitude". Their
        leader is also named; he is called in P&acirc;li N&acirc;taputta, in
        Sanskrit J&ntilde;&acirc;tiputra, that is the son of J&ntilde;&acirc;ti
        or N&acirc;ta. The similarity between these words and the names of the
        family J&ntilde;&acirc;ti, J&ntilde;&acirc;ta or Naya, to which Vardham&acirc;na
        belonged is apparent. Now since in older Buddhist literature, the title
        'the son of the man of the family N. N.' is very often used instead of
        the individual's name, as for example, 'the son of the S&acirc;kiya' is
        put for Buddha-S&acirc;kiyaputta, so that it is difficult not to suppose
        that N&acirc;taputta or J&ntilde;&acirc;tiputra, the leader of the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha
        or Nirgrantha sect, is the same person as Vardham&acirc;na, the
        descendant of the J&ntilde;&acirc;ti family and founder of the
        Nirgrantha or Jaina sect. If we follow up this idea, and gather together
        the different remarks of the Buddhists about the opponents of Buddha,
        then it is apparent that his identity with Vardham&acirc;na is certain.
        A number of rules of doctrine are ascribed to him, which are also found
        among the Jainas, and some events in his life, which we have already
        found in the accounts of the life of Vardham&acirc;na, are related.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one place in the oldest part of the Singalese canon, the assertion is
        put into the mouth of Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha N&acirc;taputta, that the
        <i>Kiriy&acirc;v&acirc;da</i>--the doctrine of activity, separates his
        system from Buddha's teaching. We shall certainly recognise in this
        doctrine, the rule of the <i>Kiriy&acirc;</i>, the activity of souls,
        upon which Jainism places so great importance. [<a href="#b1_fn26"
        id="b1_fm26">26</a>] Two other rules from the doctrine of souls are
        quoted in a later work, not canonical: there it is stated, in a
        collection of false doctrines which Buddha's rivals taught, that Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha
        asserts that cold water was living. Little drops of water contained
        small souls, large drops, large souls. Therefore he forbade his
        followers, the use of cold water. It is not difficult, in these curious
        rules to recognise the Jaina dogma, which asserts the existence of
        souls, even in the mass of lifeless elements of earth, water, fire, and
        wind. This also proves, that the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha admitted the
        classification of souls, so often ridiculed by the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s,
        which distinguishes between great and small. This work, like others,
        ascribes to Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha the assertion, that the so-called
        three <i>dan
        <!-- dot under n -->d
        <!-- dot under d -->a</i>--the three instruments by which man can cause
        injury to creatures--thought, word, and body, are separate active causes
        of sin. The Jaina doctrine agrees also in this case, which always
        specially represents the three and prescribes for each a special
        control. [<a href="#b1_fn27" id="b1_fm27">27</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides these rules, which perfectly agree with one another, there are
        still two doctrines of the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha to be referred to
        which seem to, or really do, contradict the Jainas; namely, it is stated
        that N&acirc;taputta demanded from his disciples the taking of four, not
        as in Vardham&acirc;na's case, of five great vows. Although this
        difficulty may seem very important at first glance, it is, however, set
        aside by an oft repeated assertion in the Jaina works. They repeatedly
        say that P&agrave;r&#347;va, the twenty-third Jina only recognised four
        vows, and Vardham&acirc;na added the fifth. The Buddhists have therefore
        handed down a dogma which Jainism recognises. The question is merely
        whether they or the Jainas are the more to be trusted. If the latter,
        and it is accepted that Vardham&acirc;na was merely the reformer of an
        old religion, then the Buddhists must be taxed with an easily possible
        confusion between the earlier and later teachers. If, on the other hand,
        the Jaina accounts of their twenty-third prophet are regarded as
        mythical, and Vardham&acirc;na is looked upon as the true founder of the
        sect,--then the doctrine of the four vows must be ascribed to the
        latter, and we must accept as a fact that he had changed his views on
        this point. In any case, however, the Buddhist statement speaks for,
        rather than against, the identity of Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha with Jina. [<a
        href="#b1_fn28" id="b1_fm28">28</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Vardham&acirc;na's system, on the other hand, is quite irreconcilable
        with N&acirc;taputta's assertion that virtue as well as sin, happiness
        as well as unhappiness is unalterably fixed for men by fate, and nothing
        in their destiny can be altered by the carrying out of the holy law. It
        is, however, just as irreconcilable with the other Buddhist accounts of
        the teaching of their opponent; because it is absolutely unimaginable,
        that the same man, who lays vows upon his followers, the object of which
        is to avoid sin, could nevertheless make virtue and sin purely dependent
        upon the disposition of fate, and preach the uselessness of carrying out
        the law. The accusation that N&acirc;taputta embraced fatalism must
        therefore be regarded as an invention and an outcome of sect hatred as
        well as of the wish to throw discredit on their opponents. [<a
        href="#b1_fn29" id="b1_fm29">29</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Buddhist remarks on the personality and life of N&acirc;taputta are
        still more remarkable. They say repeatedly that he laid claim to the
        dignity of an Arhat and to omniscience which the Jainas also claim for
        their prophet, whom they prefer simply to call 'the Arhat' and who
        possesses the universe-embracing '<i>Kevala</i>' knowledge. [<a
        href="#b1_fn30" id="b1_fm30">30</a>] A history of conversions, tells us
        further that N&acirc;taputta and his disciples disdained to cover their
        bodies; we are told just the same of Vardham&acirc;na. [<a
        href="#b1_fn31" id="b1_fm31">31</a>] A story in the oldest part of the
        Singalese canon gives an interesting and important instance of his
        activity in teaching. Buddha, so the legend runs, once came to the town
        Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;, the seat of the Kshatriya of the Lichchhavi
        race. His name, his law, his community were highly praised by the nobles
        of the Lichchhavi in the senate-house. S&icirc;ha, their general, who
        was a follower of the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha, became anxious to know the
        great teacher. He went to his master N&acirc;taputta, who happened to be
        staying in Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc; just then, and asked permission to
        pay the visit. Twice N&acirc;taputta refused him. Then S&icirc;ha
        determined to disobey him. He sought Buddha out, heard his teaching and
        was converted by him. In order to show his attachment to his new teacher
        he invited Buddha and his disciples to eat with him. On the acceptance
        of the invitation, S&icirc;ha commanded his servants to provide flesh in
        honour of the occasion. This fact came to the ears of the followers of
        the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha. Glad to have found an occasion to damage
        Buddha, they hurried in great numbers through the town, crying out, that
        S&icirc;ha had caused a great ox to be killed for Buddha's
        entertainment; that Buddha had eaten of the flesh of the animal although
        he knew it had been killed on his account, and was, therefore guilty of
        the death of the animal. The accusation was brought to Siha's notice and
        was declared by him to be a calumny. Buddha, however preached a sermon
        after the meal, in which he forbade his disciples to partake of the
        flesh of such animals as had been killed on their account. The legend
        also corroborates the account in the Jaina works, according to which
        Vardham&acirc;na often resided in Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc; and had a
        strong following in that town. It is probably related to show that his
        sect was stricter, as regards the eating of flesh, than the Buddhists, a
        point, which again agrees with the statutes of the Jainas. [<a
        href="#b1_fn32" id="b1_fm32">32</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The account of N&acirc;taputta's death is still more important. "Thus I
        heard it", says an old book of the Singalese canon, the <i>S&acirc;mag&acirc;ma
        Sutta</i>, "once the Venerable one lived in S&acirc;mag&acirc;ma in the
        land of the S&acirc;kya. At that time, however, certainly the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha
        N&acirc;taputta had died in P&acirc;v&acirc;. After his death the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha
        wandered about disunited, separate, quarrelling, fighting, wounding each
        other with words." [<a href="#b1_fn33" id="b1_fm33">33</a>] Here we have
        complete confirmation of the statement of the Jaina canon as to the
        place where Vardham&acirc;na entered <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, as well as of the statement that a schism
        occurred immediately after his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        The harmony between the Buddhist and Jaina tradition, as to the person
        of the head of the Nirgrantha is meanwhile imperfect. It is disturbed by
        the description of N&acirc;taputta as a member of the Br&acirc;hmanic
        sect of the &Acirc;gnive&#347;y&acirc;yana, whilst Vardham&acirc;na
        belonged to the K&acirc;&#347;yapa. The point is however so
        insignificant, that an error on the part of the Buddhists is easily
        possible. [<a href="#b1_fn34" id="b1_fm34">34</a>] It is quite to be
        understood that perfect exactness is not to be expected among the
        Buddhists or any other sect in describing the person of a hated enemy.
        Enmity and scorn, always present, forbid that. The most that one can
        expect is that the majority and most important of the facts given may
        agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This condition is undoubtedly fulfilled in the case on hand. It cannot,
        therefore be denied, that, in spite of this difference, in spite also of
        the absurdity of one article of the creed ascribed to him, Vardham&acirc;na
        J&ntilde;&acirc;tiputra, the founder of the Nirgrantha--or Jaina
        community is none other than Buddha's rival. From Buddhist accounts in
        their canonical works as well as in other books, it may be seen that
        this rival was a dangerous and influential one, and that even in
        Buddha's time his teaching had spread considerably. Their legends about
        conversions from other sects very often make mention of Nirgrantha
        sectarians, whom Buddha's teaching or that of his disciples had
        alienated from their faith. Also they say in their descriptions of other
        rivals of Buddha, that these, in order to gain esteem, copied the
        Nirgrantha and went unclothed, or that they were looked upon by the
        people as Nirgrantha holy ones, because they happened to have lost their
        clothes. Such expressions would be inexplicable if Vardham&acirc;na's
        community had not become of great importance. [<a href="#b1_fn35"
        id="b1_fm35">35</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        This agrees with several remarks in the Buddhist chronicles, which
        assert the existence of the Jainas in different districts of India
        during the first century after Buddha's death. In the memoirs of the
        Chinese Buddhist and pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang, who visited India in the
        beginning of the seventh century of our era, is to be found an extract
        from the ancient annals of Magadha, which proves the existence of the
        Nirgrantha or Jainas in their original home from a very early time. [<a
        href="#b1_fn36" id="b1_fm36">36</a>] This extract relates to the
        building of the great monastry at N&acirc;land&acirc;, the high school
        of Buddhism in eastern India, which was founded shortly after Buddha's
        <i>Nirv&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, and mentions incidentally that a Nirgrantha
        who was a great astrologer and prophet had prophesied the future success
        of the new building. At almost as early a period the <i>Mah&acirc;van[g]sa</i>,
        composed in the fifth century A.D., fixes the appearance of the
        Nirgrantha in the island of Ceylon. It is said that the king Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uk&acirc;bhaya,
        who ruled in the beginning of the second century after Buddha, from
        367-307 B.C. built a temple and a monastery for two Nirgranthas. The
        monastery is again mentioned in the same work in the account of the
        reign of a later king Va<i>t</i><i>t</i>&acirc;g&acirc;mini, cir. 38-10
        B.C. It is related that Va<i>t</i><i>t</i>&acirc;g&acirc;mini being
        offended by the inhabitants, caused it to be destroyed after it had
        existed during the reigns of twenty one kings, and erected a Buddhist
        Sam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->gh&acirc;r&acirc;ma in its place. The latter piece of
        information is found also in the <i>D&icirc;pavan[g]sa</i> of more than
        a century earlier. [<a href="#b1_fn37" id="b1_fm37">37</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        None of these works can indeed be looked upon as a truly historical
        source. There are, even in those paragraphs which treat of the oldest
        history after Buddha's death, proofs enough that they simply hand down a
        faulty historical tradition. In spite of this, their statements on the
        Nirgrantha, cannot be denied a certain weight, because they are closely
        connected on the one side with the Buddhist canon, and on the other they
        agree with the indisputable sources of history, which relate to a
        slightly later period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first authentic information on Vardham&acirc;na's sect is given by
        our oldest inscriptions, the religious edicts of the Maurya king A&#347;oka,
        who, according to tradition was anointed in the year 219 after Buddha's
        death, and--as the reference to his Grecian contemporaries, Antiochos,
        Magas, Alexander, Ptolemaeus and Antigonas confirms,--ruled, during the
        second half of the third century B.C. over the whole of India with the
        exception of the Dekhan. This prince interested himself not only in
        Buddhism, which he professed in his later years, but he took care, in a
        fatherly way, as he repeatedly relates, of all other religious sects in
        his vast kingdom. In the fourteenth year of his reign, he appointed
        officials, called law-superintendents, whose duty it was to watch over
        the life of the different communities, to settle their quarrels, to
        control the distribution of their legacies and pious gifts. He says of
        them in the second part of the seventh 'pillar' edict, which he issued
        in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, "My superintendents are occupied
        with various charitable matters, they are also engaged with all sects of
        ascetics and householders; I have so arranged that they will also be
        occupied with the affairs of the <i>Sam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over m -->gha</i>; likewise I have arranged that they will be
        occupied with the &Acirc;j&icirc;vika Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s; I have
        arranged it that they will also be occupied with the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha".
        [<a href="#b1_fn38" id="b1_fm38">38</a>] The word <i>Sam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over m -->gha</i> serves here as usual for the Buddhist monks.
        The &Acirc;j&iacute;vikas, whose name completely disappears later, are
        often named in the sacred writings of the Buddhists and the Jainas as an
        influential sect. They enjoyed the special favour of A&#347;oka, who, as
        other inscriptions testify, caused several caves at Bar&agrave;bar to be
        made into dwellings for their ascetics. [<a href="#b1_fn39" id="b1_fm39">39</a>]
        As in the still older writings of the Buddhist canon, the name Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha
        here can refer only to the followers of Vardham&acirc;na. As they are
        here, along with the other two favourites, counted worthy of special
        mention, we may certainly conclude that they were of no small importance
        at the time. Had they been without influence and of small numbers A&#347;oka
        would hardly have known of them, or at least would not have singled them
        out from the other numerous nameless sects of which he often speaks. It
        may also be supposed that they were specially numerous in their old
        home, as A&#347;oka's capital P&acirc;<i>t</i>aliputra lay in this land.
        Whether they spread far over these boundaries, cannot be ascertained.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand we possess two documents from the middle of the next
        century which prove that they advanced into south-eastern India as far
        as Kalim[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->ga. These are the inscriptions at Kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>agiri
        in Orissa, of the great King Kh&acirc;ravela and his first wife, who
        governed the east coast of India from the year 152 to 165 of the Maurya
        era that is, in the first half of second century B.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        The larger inscription, unfortunately very much disfigured, contains an
        account of the life of Kh&acirc;ravela from his childhood till the
        thirteenth year of his reign. It begins with an appeal to the Arhat and
        Siddha, which corresponds to the beginning of the five-fold form of
        homage still used among the Jainas, and mentions the building of temples
        in honour of the Arhat as well as an image of the first Jina, which was
        taken away by a hostile king. The second and smaller inscription asserts
        that Kh&acirc;ravela's wife caused a cave to be prepared for the
        ascetics of Kalinga, "who believed on the Arhat." [<a href="#b1_fn40"
        id="b1_fm40">40</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        From a somewhat later period, as the characters show, from the first
        century B.C. comes a dedicatory inscription which has been found far to
        the west of the original home of the Jainas, in Mathur&agrave; on the
        Jamn&acirc;. It tells of the erection of a small temple in honour of the
        Arhat Vardham&acirc;na, also of the dedication of seats for the
        teachers, a cistern, and a stone table. The little temple, it says,
        stood beside the temple of the guild of tradesmen, and this remark
        proves, that Mathur&acirc;, which, according to the tradition of the
        Jainas, was one of the chief scats of their religion, possessed a
        community of Jainas even before the time of this inscription. [<a
        href="#b1_fn41" id="b1_fm41">41</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        A large member of dedicatory inscriptions have come to light, which are
        dated from the year 5 to 98 of the era of the Indo-Skythian kings,
        Kanishka, Huvishka, and V&acirc;sudeva (Bazodeo) and therefore belong at
        latest to the end of the first and to the second century A.D. They are
        all on the pedestals of statues, which are recognisable partly by the
        special mention of the names of Vardham&acirc;na and the Arhat Mah&acirc;v&iacute;ra,
        partly by absolute nudity and other marks. They show, that the Jaina
        community continued to flourish in Mathur&acirc; and give besides
        extraordinarily important information, as I found in a renewed research
        into the ancient history of the sect. In a number of them, the
        dedicators of the statues give not only their own names, but also those
        of the religious teachers to whose communities they belonged. Further,
        they give these teachers their official titles, still used among the
        Jainas: <i>v&acirc;chaka</i>, 'teacher', and <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->in</i>, 'head of a school'. Lastly they specify the
        names of the schools to which the teachers belonged, and those of their
        subdivisions. The schools are called, <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, 'companies'; the subdivisions, <i>kula</i>,
        'families' and <i>&#347;&acirc;kh&agrave;</i>, 'branches'. Exactly the
        same division into <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a, &#347;&acirc;kh&agrave;</i>, and <i>kula</i> is
        found in a list in one of the canonical works, of the &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras,
        the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, which gives the number of the patriarchs
        and of the schools founded by them, and it is of the highest importance,
        that, in spite of mutilation and faulty reproduction of the
        inscriptions, nine of the names, which appear in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        are recognisable in them, of which part agree exactly, part, through the
        fault of the stone-mason or wrong reading by the copyist, are somewhat
        defaced. According to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, Sushita, the ninth
        successor to Vardham&acirc;na In the position of patriarch, together
        with his companion Supratibuddha, founded the 'Ko<i>d</i>iya' or
        'Kautika <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, which split up into four '<i>s&acirc;kh&agrave;</i>,
        and four '<i>kula</i>'. Inscription No. 4. which is dated in the year 9
        of the king Kanishka or 87. A.D. (?) gives us a somewhat ancient form of
        the name of the <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a Kot
        <!-- dot under t -->iya</i> and that of one of its branches exactly
        corresponding to the <i>Vairi &#347;&agrave;kh&acirc;</i>. Mutilated or
        wrongly written, the first word occurs also in inscriptions Nos. 2, 6
        and 9 as <i>koto-, ket
        <!-- dot under t -->t
        <!-- dot under t -->iya</i>, and <i>ka</i> ..., the second in No. 6 as
        <i>Vor&acirc;</i>. One of the families of this <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, the <i>V&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->iya kula</i> is mentioned in No. 6, and perhaps in
        No. 4. The name of a second, the <i>Pra&#347;nav&agrave;han
        <!-- dot under n -->aka</i>, seems to have appeared in No. 19. The last
        inscription mentions also another branch of the Kot
        <!-- dot under t -->iya gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a, the <i>Majhim&acirc; s&acirc;kh&acirc;</i>,
        which, according to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra,</i> was founded by
        Priyagantha the second disciple of Susthita. <a id="p44"></a>Two still
        older schools which, according to tradition, sprang from the fourth
        disciple of the eighth patriarch, along with some of their divisions
        appear in inscriptions Nos. 20 and 10. These are the <i>Aryya-Udehik&icirc;ya
        gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, called the school of the &Acirc;rya-Roha<i>n</i>a
        in the <i> Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, to which belonged the <i>Parih&acirc;saka
        kula</i> and the <i> P&ucirc;rnap&acirc;trik&acirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;,</i>
        as also the <i>Char&acirc;n
        <!-- dot under n -->a gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i> with the <i>Pr&icirc;tidharmika kula.</i> Each
        of these names is, however, somewhat mutilated by one or more errata in
        writing. [<a href="#b1_fn42" id="b1_fm42">42</a>] The statements in the
        inscriptions about the teachers and their schools are of no small
        importance in themselves for the history of the Jainas. If, at the end
        of the first century A.D.(?) many separate schools of Jaina ascetics
        existed, a great age and lively activity, as well as great care as
        regards the traditions of the sect, may be inferred. The agreement of
        the inscriptions with the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> leads still further
        however: it proves on the one side that the Jainas of Mathur&acirc; were
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbara, and that the schism, which split the sect into
        two rival branches occurred long before the beginning of our era. On the
        other hand it proves that the tradition of the Svet&acirc;mbara really
        contains ancient historic elements, and by no means deserves to be
        looked upon with distrust. It is quite probable that, like all
        traditions, it is not altogether free from error. But it can no longer
        be declared to be the result of a later intentional misrepresentation,
        made in order to conceal the dependence of Jainism on Buddhism. It is no
        longer possible to dispute its authenticity with regard to those points
        which are confirmed by independent statements of other sects, and to
        assert, for example, that the Jaina account of the life of Vardham&acirc;na,
        which agrees with the statements of the Buddists, proves nothing as
        regards the age of Jainism because in the late fixing of the canon of
        the &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras in the sixth century after Christ it may have
        been drawn from Buddhist works. Such an assertion which, under all
        circumstances, is a bold one, becomes entirely untenable when it is
        found that the tradition in question states correctly facts which lie
        not quite three centuries distant from Vardham&acirc;na's time, and that
        the sect, long before the first century of our era kept strict account
        of their internal affairs. [<a href="#b1_fn43" id="b1_fm43">43</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately the testimony to the ancient history of the Jainas, so far
        as made known by means of inscriptions, terminates here. Interesting as
        it would be to follow the traces of their communities in the later
        inscriptions, which become so numerous from the fifth century A.D.
        onwards and in the description of his travels by Hiuen Tsiang, who found
        them spread through the whole of India and even beyond its boundaries,
        it would be apart from our purpose. The documents quoted suffice,
        however, to confirm the assertion that during the first five centuries
        after Buddha's death both the statements of Buddhist tradition and real
        historical sources give evidence to the existence of the Jainas as an
        important religious community independent of Buddhism, and that there
        are among the historical sources some which entirely clear away the
        suspicion that the tradition of the Jainas themselves is intentionally
        falsified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage gained for Indian history from the conclusion that Jainism
        and Buddhism are two contemporary sects--having arisen in the same
        district,--is no small one. First, this conclusion shows that the
        religious movement of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. in eastern
        India must have been a profound one. If not only one, but certainly two,
        and perhaps more reformers, appeared at the same time, preaching
        teachers, who opposed the existing circumstances in the same manner, and
        each of whom gained no small number of followers for their doctrines,
        the desire to overthrow the Brahmanical order of things must have been
        generally and deeply felt. This conclusion shows then that the
        transformation of the religious life in India was not merely the work of
        a religious community. Many strove to attain this object although
        separated from one another. It is now recognisable, though
        preliminarily, in one point only, that the religious history of India
        from the fifth century B.C. to the eighth or ninth A.D. was not made up
        of the fight between Brahmanism and Buddhism alone. This conclusion
        allows us, lastly, to hope that the thorough investigation of the oldest
        writings of the Jainas and their relations with Buddhism on the one hand
        and with Brahmanism on the other will afford many important ways of
        access to a more exact knowledge concerning the religious ideas which
        prevailed in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and to the
        establishment of the boundaries of originality between the different
        systems.

        APPENDIX A.

      <p>
        Copies of the mutilated inscriptions referred to, were published by
        General Sir A. Cunningham in his <i>Archaeological Survey Reports</i>,
        vol. III, plates xiii-xv. Unfortunately they have been presented from
        'copies' and are therefore full of errors, which are due for the most
        part, doubtless, to the copyist and not to the sculptor. It is not
        difficult, however, in most cases under consideration here, to restore
        the correct reading. Usually only vowel signs are omitted or misread
        and, here, and there, consonants closely resembling one another as <i>va</i>
        and <i>cha, va</i>, and <i>dha, ga</i> and <i>&#347;a, la</i> and <i>na</i>
        are interchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formulae of the inscriptions are almost universally the same. First
        comes the date, then follows the name of a reverend teacher, next, the
        mention of the school and the subdivision of it to which he belonged.
        Then the persons, who dedicated the statues are named (mostly women),
        and who belonged to the community of the said teacher. The description
        of the gift forms the conclusion. The dialect of the inscriptions shows
        that curious mixture of Sanskr
        <!-- dot under r -->&#301;t and Pr&acirc;kr
        <!-- dot under r -->&#301;t which is found in almost all documents of
        the Indo-Skythian kings, and whichas Dr. Hoernle was the first to
        recognise--was one of the literary languages of northern and
        northwestern India during the first centuries before and after the
        commencement of our era.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the calculation of dates, I use the favourite starting point for the
        era of the Indo-Skythian kings, which unfortunately, is not certainly
        determined, and assume that it is identical with the <i>Saka</i> era of
        78-&frac14; A.D. The rule of these princes could not have fallen later:
        in my opinion it was somewhat earlier [<a href="#b1_fn44" id="b1_fm44">44</a>]
        I give here transcripts and restorations of such inscriptions as mention
        Jaina schools or titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The inscription which is the most important for my purpose and at the
        same time one of the best preserved, is Sir A. Cunningham's No. 6, plate
        xiii, which was found on the base of a Jaina image (<i>Arch. Sur. Rep</i>.
        vol. III, p. 31). The copy compared with a rubbing gives the following
        reading, (the letters within parentheses are damaged):
      </p>
      <div class="verse">

        The lacuna in line 2, after <i>Dattilasya</i>, probably contained the
        word <i>duhituye</i> or <i>dh&ucirc;tuye</i> and part of a male name of
        which only the letter <i>vi</i> is visible. In l. 3, possibly <i>kot
        <!-- dot under t -->habiniye</i> is to be read instead of <i>kot
        <!-- dot under n -->hubikiye</i>. As there is room for one more letter
        at the end of the line, I propose to read <i>m&acirc;tuye</i>. In l. 5,
        <i>Din&acirc;ye</i> would stand for <i>Datt&acirc;y&acirc;h[postvocalic]</i>
        and be the genitive of a female name <i>Dinn&acirc;</i> or <i>Datt&acirc;</i>,
        which has been shortened <i>bh&acirc;m&acirc;vat</i>. There can be no
        doubt that the word <i>&#347;r&icirc;</i>, or <i>&#347;iri</i>, which is
        required, has stood before <i>Vardham&acirc;na</i>. With these
        restorations the translation is as follows:

          made] for the welfare [and happiness] of [all created beings] by Vikat&acirc;,
          the house-wife of Bha<i>t</i><i>t</i>imita (Bhat<i>t</i>imitra) and
          [daughter of] Br&acirc;hma ...--(this statue being) the <i>nirvartana</i>
          of the preacher N&acirc;ganam[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over m -->idi, out of the Ko<i>t</i>iya school (<i>gan
          <!-- dot under n -->a</i>), the V&acirc;<i>n</i>iya line (<i>kula</i>),
          (and) the Vairi branch (<i>&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;</i>)."
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If we now turn to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, we find that Su<i>t</i><i>t</i>hiya
        or Susthita, the eighth successor of Vardham&acirc;na, founded the Kau<i>t</i>ika
        or Ko<i>d</i>iya ga<i>n</i>a, which split up into four &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;s
        and four kulas. The third of the former was the Vajr&icirc; or Vair&icirc;,
        and the third of the latter was the V&acirc;<i>n</i>&icirc;ya or V&acirc;<i>n</i>ijja.
        It is evident that the names of the <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a, kula</i>, and <i>&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;</i> agree
        with those mentioned in the two inscriptions, Ko<i>t</i>iya being a
        somewhat older form of Ko<i>d</i>iya. But it is interesting to note that
        the further subdivision of the Vair&icirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;--the
        &#346;irik&acirc; bhatti (Srik&acirc; bhakti) which inscription No. 6
        mentions, is not known to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>. This is a gap
        such as may by be expected to occur in a list handed down by oral
        tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The Ko<i>t</i>ika ga<i>n</i>a is again mentioned in the badly
        mutilated inscription No. 19, plate xv. A complete restoration is
        impossible.
      </p>
      <div class="verse">

        <p>
          2. <i>K|ot

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        It may, however, be inferred from the fragments of the first line that
        the dedication was made by a woman who was described as the wife (<i>kut
        <!-- dot under t -->umbin&icirc;</i>) of one person and as the
        daughter-in-law (<i>vadhu</i>) of another. The first part of line 2,
        restored as above gives--"in the congregation of ... out of the Ko<i>t</i>iya
        school, the Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hanaka line and the Majham&acirc;
        branch...." The restoration of the two names Ko<i>t</i>iya and Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hanaka
        seems to me absolutely certain, because they exactly fill the blanks in
        the inscription, and because the information in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        (S. B. E. vol. XXII, p. 293) regarding the Madhyam&acirc;&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;
        points in that direction. The latter work tells us that Priyagantha, the
        second pupil of Susthita and Supratibuddha, founded a &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;,
        called Madhyam&acirc; or Majhim&acirc;.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our inscriptions show that Professor Jacobi's explanation of the
        terms <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a, kula</i> and <i>&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;</i> [<a
        href="#b1_fn48" id="b1_fm48">48</a>] is correct and that the first
        denotes the school, the second the line of teachers, and the third a
        branch which separated from such a line, it follows that the &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;s
        named in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> without the mention of a <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i> and <i>kula</i>, must belong to the last
        preceding <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i> and derive their origin from one of its <i>kulas</i>.
        Hence the Madhyam&acirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc; doubtless was included
        in the Kau<i>t</i>ika ga<i>n</i>a, and an offshoot of one of its <i>kulas</i>,
        the fourth of which is called Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hanaka or Pa<i>n</i>hav&acirc;ha<i>n</i>aya.
        The correctness of these inferences is proved by R&acirc;ja&#347;ckhara's
        statement regarding his spiritual descent at the end of the <i>Prabandha
        kosha</i>, which he composed in Vik. sam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over m --> 1405. He informs us that he belonged to the Ko<i>t</i>ika
        ga<i>n</i>a, the Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hana kula, the Madhyam&acirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;,
        the Harshapur&icirc;ya gachha and the Maladh&acirc;ri samt&acirc;na,
        founded by the illustrious Abhayas&ucirc;ri.

        For the last words of l. 2 I do not dare to propose an emendation; I

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <i>Varane</i> must be a mistake for the very similar word <i>Ch&acirc;rane</i>.
        The second <i>kula</i> of this <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i> which, according to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        (<i>S.B.E</i>. vol. XXII, p. 291) was founded by &#346;r&icirc;gupta,
        the fifth pupil of &Acirc;rya Suhastin, is the Pr&icirc;tidharmika (p.
        292). It is easy to see that a similar name is hidden in the compound <i>Petivamikakutav&acirc;chakasya</i>
        'of the preacher of the Petiv&acirc;mika line'; and an inscription
        excavated by Dr. Fuhrer at Mathur&acirc; mentions the Petiv&acirc;mika (<i>kula</i>)
        of the V&acirc;rana <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>. With the second line little can be done: if
        the letters <i>prap&acirc;</i> are correct and form a word, one of the
        objects dedicated must have been a drinking fountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. The inscription No. 20, plate xv offers likewise slightly corrupt and
        mutilated names of a <i>gan
        <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, a <i>kula</i> and a <i>s&acirc;kh&acirc;</i>,
        mentioned in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>. In the lithographed copy lines
        3-7 are hopeless and there is no rubbing to help. The word <i>thitu</i>
        'of a daughter' in line 6, and the following <i>ma.uya</i> which is
        probably a misreading of <i>m&acirc;tuye</i> 'of the mother' show that
        this dedication also was made by a female. The last four syllables <i>vato
        maho</i> are probably the remnant of another namask&acirc;ra--<i>namo
        bhagavato Mah&acirc;v&icirc;rasya.</i> As regards the proper names,
        Aryya Rehiniya is an impossible form; but on comparison with the next
        inscription to be mentioned, it is evident that the stone must have read
        <i> Aryvodchikiy&acirc;to</i> or <i>Aryyadehikiy&acirc;to g>n
        <!-- dot under n -->&acirc;[to] </i>. [<a href="#b1_fn49" id="b1_fm49">49</a>]
        According to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> (<i>S.B.E</i>. vol. XXII, p.
        291) &Acirc;rya-Roha<i>n</i>a was the first pupil of &Acirc;rya Suhastin
        and founded the Uddeha ga<i>n</i>a. The latter split up into four &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;s
        and into six kulas. The name of its fourth &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;, P&ucirc;r<i>n</i>apatrik&acirc;,
        closely resembles--especially in its consonantal elements--that of the
        inscription, <i>Petaputrik&acirc;</i>, and I do not hesitate in
        correcting the latter to <i>Ponapatrik&acirc;</i> which would be the
        equivalent of Sansk. Paur<i>n</i>apatrik&acirc;. Among the six kulas is
        the Parih&acirc;saka, and considering the other agreements, I believe it
        probable that the mutilated name read as <i>Puridha.ka</i> is a
        misreading of <i>Parih&acirc;ka</i>, We may emend the first two times
        and read as follows,--

        These and many other statements in the inscriptions, about the teachers
        and their schools are of no small importance in themselves for the early
        history of the Jainas. The agreement of the above with the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        can best be shown by placing the statements in question against one
        another. The inscriptions prove the actual existence of twenty of the
        subdivisions mentioned in the Sthavir&acirc;vali of the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>.
        Among its eight ga<i>n</i>as we can certainly trace three, possibly
        four--the Uddchika, V&acirc;ra<i>n</i>a, Ve&#347;av&acirc;<i>d</i>iya(?)

          Jainas, one often finds the view expressed, that the <i>Digambaras</i>
          belong only to the south, and the <i>&#346;vet&acirc;mbaras</i> to the
          north. This is by no means the case. The former in the Panj&acirc;b,
          in eastern R&acirc;jput&acirc;na and in the North West Provinces, are
          just as numerous, if not more so, than the latter, and also appear
          here and there in western R&acirc;jput&acirc;na and Gujar&acirc;t: see

          <a href="#b1_fm2" id="b1_fn2"><b>Footnote 2</b></a>: The ascetics of
          lower rank, now called Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>it, now-a-days wear the
          costume of the country. The Bha<i>t</i><i>t</i>&acirc;raka, the heads
          of the sect, usually wrap themselves in a large cloth (<i>chadr</i>).
          They lay it off during meals. A disciple then rings a bell as a sign
          that entrance is forbidden (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> loc. cit.). When the
          present custom first arose cannot be ascertained. From the description
          of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang (St. Julien, <i>Vie.</i> p. 224),
          who calls them Li-hi, it appears that they were still faithful to
          their principles in the beginning of the seventh century A.D. "The
          Li-hi (Nirgranthis) distinguish themselves by leaving their bodies
          naked and pulling out their hair. Their skin is all cracked, their
          feet are hard and chapped: like rotting trees that one sees near
          rivers."

          <a href="#b1_fm4" id="b1_fn4"><b>Footnote 4</b></a>: In the
          stereotyped introductions to the sermons of Jina it is always pointed
          out that they are addressed to the Aryan and non-Aryan. Thus in the <i>Aupap&acirc;tika
          S&ucirc;tra</i> &sect; 56. (Leumann) it runs as follows: <i>tesim[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over m --> savvesim[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over m --> &acirc;r
          <!-- dot under r -->iyaman&acirc;riyanam[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over m --> agil&acirc;e dhammatm[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over m --> &acirc;ikkhai</i> "to all these, Aryans and
          non-Aryans, he taught the law untiringly". In accordance with this
          principle, conversions of people of low caste, such as gardeners,
          dyers, etc., are not uncommon even at the present day. Muhammadans
          too, regarded as Mlechcha, are still received among the Jaina
          communities. Some cases of the kind were communicated to me in
          Ah[postvocalic]mad&acirc;b&acirc;d in the year 1876, as great triumphs
          of the Jainas. Tales of the conversion of the emperor Akbar, through
          the patriarch H&icirc;ravijaya (<i>Ind. Antiq.</i> Vol. XI, p. 256),
          and of the spread of the Digambara sect in an island Jainabhadri, in
          the Indian Ocean (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> Vol. VII, p. 28) and in Arabia,
          shew that the Jainas are familiar with the idea of the conversion of
          non-Indians. Hiuen Tsiang's note on the appearance of the Nirgrantha
          or Digambara in Kiapishi (Beal, <i>Si-yu-ki</i>, Vol. I, p. 55),
          points apparently to the fact that they had, in the North West at
          least, spread their missionary activity beyond the borders of India.

        <div class="footnote">
          <a href="#b1_fm5" id="b1_fn5"><b>Footnote 5</b></a>: Even the
          canonical works of the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara, as for example, the <i>&Acirc;ch&acirc;r&acirc;m[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over n -->ga (Sacred Books of the East</i>, Vol. XXII, p.
          88-186) contain directions for nuns. It seems, however, that they have
          never played such an important part as in Buddhism. At the present
          time, the few female orders among the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara consist
          entirely of virgin widows, whose husbands have died in childhood,
          before the beginning of their life together. It is not necessary to
          look upon the admission of nuns among the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara as an
          imitation of Buddhist teaching, as women were received into some of
          the old Brahmanical orders; see my note to <i>Manu</i>, VIII, 363, (<i>Sac.
          Bks. of the East</i>, Vol. XXV, p. 317). Among the Digambaras,
          exclusion of women was demanded from causes not far to seek. They give
          as their reason for it, the doctrine that women are not capable of
          attaining <i>Nirv&acirc;n

          <a href="#b1_fm6" id="b1_fn6"><b>Footnote 6</b></a>: The titles
          Siddha, Buddha and Mukta are certainly borrowed by both sects from the
          terminology of the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s, which they used, even in
          olden times, to describe those saved during their lifetimes and used
          in the &#346;aivite doctrine to describe a consecrated one who is on
          the way to redemption. An Arhat, among the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>s, is a
          man distinguished for his knowledge and pious life (comp. for example
          &Acirc;pastamba, <i>Dharmas&ucirc;tra.</i> I, 13, 13; II, 10, I.) and
          this idea is so near that of the Buddhists and the Jainas that it may
          well be looked upon as the foundation of the latter. The meaning of T&icirc;rthakara
          "prophet, founder of religion", is derived from the Br&acirc;hmanic
          use of <i>t&icirc;rtha</i> in the sense of "doctrine". Comp. also H.

          <a href="#b1_fm20" id="b1_fn20"><b>Footnote 20</b></a>: Apart from the
          ill-supported supposition of Colebrooke, Stevenson and Thomas,
          according to which Buddha was a disloyal disciple of the founder of
          the Jainas, there is the view held by H. H. Wilson, A. Weber, and
          Lassen, and generally accepted till twenty-five years ago, that the
          Jainas are an old sect of the Buddhists. This was based, on the one
          hand, upon the resemblance of the Jaina doctrines, writings, and
          traditions to those of the Buddhists, on the other, on the fact that
          the canonical works of the Jainas show a more modern dialect than
          those of the Buddhists, and that authentic historical proofs of their
          early existence are wanting. I was myself formerly persuaded of the
          correctness of this view and even thought I recognised the Jainas in
          the Buddhist school of the Sammat&icirc;ya. On a more particular
          examination of Jaina literature, to which I was forced on account of
          the collection undertaken for the English Government in the seventies,
          I found that the Jainas had changed their name and were always, in
          more ancient times, called Nirgrantha or Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha. The
          observation that the Buddhists recognise the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha
          and relate of their head and founder, that he was a rival of Buddha's
          and died at P&acirc;v&acirc; where the last T&icirc;rthakara is said
          to have attained <i>Nirv&acirc;n
          <!-- dot under n -->a</i>, caused me to accept the view that the
          Jainas and the Buddhists sprang from the same religious movement. My
          supposition was confirmed by Jacobi, who reached the like view by
          another course, independently of mine (see <i>Zeitschrift der Deutsch
          Morg. Ges</i>. Bd. XXXV, S. 669. Note 1), pointing out that the last T&icirc;rthakara
          in the Jaina canon bears the same name as among the Buddhists. Since
          the publication of our results in the <i>Ind. Ant</i>. Vol. VII, p.
          143 and in Jacobi's introduction to his edition of the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra,</i>
          which have been further verified by Jacobi with great penetration,
          views on this question have been divided. Oldenberg, Kern, Hoernle,
          and others have accepted this new view without hesitation, while A
          Weber (<i>Indische Studien</i> Bd. XVI, S. 240) and Barth (<i>Revue de
          l'Histoire des Religions</i>, tom. III, p. 90) keep to their former
          standpoint. The latter do not trust the Jaina tradition and believe it
          probable that the statements in the same are falsified. There are
          certainly great difficulties in the way of accepting such a position
          especially the improbability that the Buddhists should have forgotten
          the fact of the defection of their hated enemy. Meanwhile, this is not
          absolutely impossible as the oldest preserved Jaina canon had its
          first authentic edition only in the fifth or sixth century of our era,
          and as yet the proof is wanting that the Jainas, in ancient times,
          possessed a fixed tradition. The belief that I am able to insert this
          missing link in the chain of argument and the hope of removing the
          doubts of my two honoured friends has caused me to attempt a connected
          statement of the whole question although this necessitates the
          repetition of much that has already been said, and is in the first
          part almost entirely a recapitulation of the results of Jacobi's
          researches.

          N&acirc;taputta's death in more detail. In a lengthy account they give
          as the cause of the same the apostacy of one of his disciples, Up&acirc;li
          who was converted by Buddha. After going over to Buddhism, Up&acirc;li
          treated his former master with scorn, and presumed to relate a parable
          which should prove the foolishness of those who believed in false
          doctrines. Thereupon the Niga<i>n</i><i>t</i>ha fell into despair. He

          <a href="#b1_fm40" id="b1_fn40"><b>Footnote 40</b></a>: The meaning of
          these inscriptions, which were formerly believed to be Buddhist, was
          first made clear by Dr. Bhangv&acirc;nl&acirc;l's Indr&acirc;ji's
          careful discussion in the <i>Actes du Vli&egrave;me Congr&egrave;s
          Internat. des Orientalistes</i> Sect. Ary. pp. 135-159. H; first
          recognised the true names of the King Kh&acirc;ravela and his
          predecessors and shewed that Kh&acirc;ravela and his wife were patrons
          of the Jainas. We have to thank him for the information that the
          inscription contains a date in the Maurya Era. I have thoroughly
          discussed his excellent article in the <i>Oesterreichischen
          Monatsschrift</i>, Bd. X, S. 231 ff. and have there given my reasons
          for differing from him on an important point, namely, the date of the
          beginning of the Maurya Era, which, according to his view begins with
          the conquest of Kalim[postvocalic]
          <!-- dot over n -->ga by A&#347;oka about 255 B. C. Even yet I find it
          impossible to accept that the expression, "in the hundred and sixty
          fifth year of the era of the Maurya Kings", can mean anything else
          than that 164 years have passed between the thirteenth year of the
          rule of Kh&acirc;ravela and the anointing of the first Maurya King
          Chandrugupta. Unfortunately it is impossible to fix the year of the
          latter occurrence, or to say more than that it took place between the
          years 322 and 312 B.C. The date given in Kh&acirc;ravela's inscription
          cannot therefore be more closely fixed than that it lies between 156
          and 147 B.C. I now add to my former remarks--that appeals to the Arhat
          and Siddha appear also in Jaina inscriptions from Mathur&acirc; and
          may be taken as a certain mark of the sect. Thus it is worthy of note
          that even in Hiuen Tsiang's time, (Beal, <i>Si-yu-ki</i>, Vol. II, p.
          205) Kalinga was one of the chief seats of the Jainas.

        The mythology of the Jainas, whilst including many of the Hindu
        divinities, to which it accords very inferior positions, is altogether
        different in composition. It has all the appearance of a purely
        constructed system. The gods are classified and subdivided into orders,
        genera, and species; all are mortal, have their ages fixed, as well as
        their abodes, and are mostly distinguished by cognizances <i>chihnas</i>
        or <i>l&acirc;&#324;chhan
        <!-- dot under n -->as</i>. Their T&icirc;rthakaras, T&igrave;rthamkaras,
        or perfected saints, are usually known as twenty-four belonging to the
        present age. But the mythology takes account also of a past and a future
        age or renovation of the world, and to each of these aeons are assigned
        twenty-four T&icirc;rthakaras. But this is not all: in their cosmogony
        they lay down other continents besides Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa-Bharata or
        that which we dwell in. These are separated from Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa
        by impassable seas, but exactly like it in every respect and are called
        Dh&acirc;tuki-kanda and Pushkar&acirc;rddha; and of each of these there
        are eastern, and western Bharata and Air&agrave;vata regions, whilst of
        Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa there is also a Bharata and an Air&acirc;vata
        region: these make the following ten regions or worlds:--
      </p>
      <div class="verse">

        p&ucirc;rva-bharata.<br /> 3. Dh&acirc;tuk&icirc;-kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a pa&#347;chima-bharata.<br />
        4. Pushkar&acirc;rddha p&ucirc;rva-bharata.<br /> 5. Pushkaravaradv&icirc;pa
        pa&#347;chima-bharata.<br /> 6. Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa air&acirc;vata-kshetra.<br />

        Puskar&acirc;rddha pa&#347;chima-air&acirc;vata.<br />
      </div>
      <p>
        To each of these is allotted twenty four past, present and future At&icirc;ts
        or Jinas,--making in all 720 of this class, for which they have invented
        names: but they are only names. [<a href="#b2_fn1" id="b2_fm1">1</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the T&icirc;rthakaras of the present age or <i>avasarpini</i> in the
        Bharata-varsha of Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa, however, we are supplied with
        minute details:--their names, parents, stations, reputed ages,
        complexions, attendants, cognizances (<i>chihna</i>) or characteristics,
        etc. and these details are useful for the explanation of the iconography
        we meet with in the shrines of Jaina temples. There the images of the T&icirc;rthakaras
        are placed on highly sculptured thrones and surrounded by other smaller
        attendant figures. In temples of the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara sect the
        images are generally of marble--white in most cases, but often black for
        images of the 19th, 2Oth, 22nd and 23rd Jinas. On the front of the
        throne or <i>&acirc;sana</i> are usually carved three small figures: at
        the proper right of the Jina is a male figure representing the Yaksha
        attendant or servant of that particular Jina; at the left end of the
        throne is the corresponding female--or Yakshin&icirc;, Yaksh&icirc; or
        &#346;&acirc;sanadev&icirc;; whilst in a panel in the middle there is
        often another dev&icirc;. At the base of the seat also, are placed nine
        very small figures representing the <i>navagraha</i> or nine planets;
        that is the sun, moon, five planets, and ascending and descending nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Jaina <i>Pur&acirc;nas</i>, legends are given to account for the
        connexion of the Yakshas and Yaksh&icirc;s with their respective T&icirc;rthakaras:
        thus, in the case of P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha, we have a story of
        two brothers Marubh&ucirc;ti and Kama<i>t</i>ha, who in eight successive
        incarnations were always enemies, and were finally born as P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha
        and Sambaradeva respectively. A P&acirc;sha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a or
        unbeliever, engaged in the <i>panch&acirc;gni</i> rite, when felling a
        tree for his fire, against the remonstrance of P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha,
        cut in pieces two snakes that were in it; the Jina, however restored
        them to life by means of the <i>pa&ntilde;chamantra</i>. They were then
        re-born in P&acirc;t&acirc;la-loka as Dhara<i>n</i>endra or N&acirc;gendra-Yaksha
        and Padm&acirc;vat&icirc;-Yakshi<i>n</i>&icirc;. When Sambaradeva or
        Meghakum&acirc;ra afterwards attacked the Arbat with a great storm,
        whilst he was engaged in the <i>K&acirc;yotsarga</i> austerity--standing
        immovable, exposed to the weather--much in the way that M&acirc;ra
        attacked &#346;&acirc;kya Buddha at Bodh-gay&acirc;, Dhara<i>n</i>endra's
        throne in P&acirc;t&acirc;la thereupon shook, and the N&acirc;ga or
        Yaksha with his consort at once sped to the protection of his former
        benefactor. Dhara<i>n</i>endra spread his many hoods over the head of
        the Arhata and the Yakshm[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot over n -->&icirc; Padm&acirc;vat&icirc; held a white umbrella (<i>&#347;veta
        chhatri</i>) over him for protection. Ever after they became his
        constant attendants, just as &#346;akra was to Buddha. The legend is
        often represented in old-sculptures, in the cave-temples at B&acirc;d&acirc;mi,
        Elura, etc., and the figure of P&acirc;r&#347;va is generally carved
        with the snake-hoods (<i>&#346;eshaphan
        <!-- dot under n -->i</i>) over him. [<a href="#b2_fn2" id="b2_fm2">2</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Other legends account for the attachment of each pair of &#346;&acirc;sanadevat&acirc;s
        to their respective Jinas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras and Digambaras agree generally in the details
        respecting the different T&icirc;rthakaras; but, from information
        furnished from Maisur, they seem to differ as to the names of the Yakshi<i>n</i>is
        attached to the several T&icirc;rthakaras, except the first and last
        two; they differ also in the names of several of the Jinas of the past
        and the future aeons. The Digambaras enlist most of the sixteen Vidy&acirc;devis
        or goddesses of knowledge among the Yakshi<i>n</i>&icirc;s, whilst the
        other sect include scarcely a third of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Vidy&acirc;dev&icirc;s, as given by Hemachandra, are--(1) Rohi<i>n</i>&icirc;;
        (2) Praj&ntilde;apt&icirc;; (3) Vajrasr
        <!-- dot under r -->i&#324;khal&acirc;; (4) Kuli&#347;&acirc;nku&#347;c&acirc;--probably
        the Anku&#347;a-Yaksh&icirc; of the &#346;vet&agrave;mb&acirc;ra
        fourteenth Jina; (5) Chakre&#347;var&icirc;; (6) Naradatt&acirc; or
        Purushadatt&acirc;; (7) K&acirc;li or K&acirc;l&icirc;k&acirc;; (8) Mah&aacute;k&acirc;l&icirc;;
        (9) Gaur&icirc;; (10) G&acirc;ndh&acirc;r&icirc;; (11) Sarv&acirc;stramah&acirc;jv&acirc;l&acirc;;
        (12) M&acirc;nav&icirc;; (13) Vairo<i>t</i>y&acirc;; (14) Achchhupt&acirc;;
        (15) M&acirc;nas&icirc;; and (16) Mah&acirc;m&acirc;nasik&acirc;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The images of the T&icirc;rthakaras are always represented seated with
        their legs crossed in front--the toes of one foot resting close upon the
        knee of the other; and the right hand lies over the left in the lap. All
        are represented exactly alike except that P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha,
        the twenty-third, has the snake-hoods over him; and, with the
        Digambaras, Sup&acirc;r&#347;va--the seventh, has also a smaller group
        of snake hoods. The Digambara images are all quite nude; those of the
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras are represented as clothed, and they decorate
        them with crowns and ornaments. They are distinguished from one another
        by their attendant <i>Yakshas</i> and <i>Yakshin
        <!-- dot under n -->&icirc;s</i> as well as by their respective <i>chihnas</i>
        or cognizances which are carved on the cushion of the throne.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Jinas are ascribed to the Ikshv&acirc;ku family (<i>kula</i>)except
        the twentieth Munisuvrata and twenty-second Nemin&acirc;tha, who were of
        the Harivam[postvocalic]
        <!-- dot under m -->&#347;a race.
      </p>
      <p>
        All received <i>d&icirc;ksh&agrave;</i> or consecration at their native
        places; and all obtained <i>j&#324;&acirc;na</i> or complete
        enlightenment at the same, except R
        <!-- dot under R -->ishabha who became a <i>Kevalin</i> at Purimat&agrave;la,
        Nemi at Girn&acirc;r, and Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra at the Rijup&agrave;luk&agrave;
        river; and twenty of them died or obtained <i>moksha</i> (deliverance in
        bliss) on Sameta-&#346;ikhara or Mount P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha in
        the west of Bengal. But R
        <!-- dot under R -->ishabha, the first, died on Ash<i>t</i>&acirc;pada--supposed

        died at Champ&acirc;puri in north Bengal; Nemin&acirc;tha on mount Girn&acirc;r;
        and Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, the last, at P&acirc;v&acirc;pur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty-one of the T&icirc;rthakaras are said to have attained Moksha in
        the K&acirc;yotsarga (Guj. <i>K&acirc;&uuml;sagga</i>) posture, and R
        <!-- dot under R -->ishabha, Nemi, and Mah&acirc;vira on the <i>padm&acirc;sana</i>

        And IV. The Vaim&acirc;nika gods are of two orders: (1) the Kalpabhavas,
        who are born in the heavenly Kalpas; and (2) the Kalp&acirc;t&icirc;tas,
        born in the regions above the Kalpas.
        <div class="verse">
          (1) The Kalpabhavas again are subdivided into twelve genera who live
          in the Kalpas after which they are named; viz,--

          (2) The Kalp&acirc;t&icirc;tas are subdivided into-- (a) the
          Graiveyakas, living on the upper part of the universe; and (b) the
          Anuttaras or those above whom there are no others.
          <div class="verse">

          they live for varying lengths of time as the heavens ascend; and in
          the fifth or highest--the great Vim&acirc;na called Sarv&acirc;rthasiddha--they
          all live thirty-three S&acirc;garopamas or periods of unimagiable

            people of the greatest, smallest and middle size; [<a href="#b2_fn8"
            id="b2_fm8">8</a>] on high places, underground, on the surface of

          </p>
          <p>
            "Ten hermaphrodites reach perfection at the same time, twenty women,
            one hundred and eight men; four householders, ten heterodox, and one

            Perfected souls are debarred from the non-world (Aloka); they reside
            on the top of the world; they leave their bodies here (below) and go

            reside the blessed perfected souls, rid of all transmigration, and
            arrived at the excellent state of perfection. The dimension of a

          About the middle of the tenth century there flourished a Jaina high

          following was obtained from a member of the sect as being their
          recognised list,--and allowing for differences of spelling, nearly
          every name may be recognised in those previously published by Mr. H.

        The late Dr. Georg B&uuml;hler's essay <i>Ueber die Indische Secte der
        Jaina</i>, read at the anniversary meeting of the Imperial Academy of
        Sciences of Vienna on the 26th May 1887, has been for some time out of
        print in the separate form. Its value as a succinct account of the
        &#346;r&acirc;vaka sect, by a scholar conversant with them and their
        religious literature is well known to European scholars; but to nearly
        all educated natives of India works published in German and other
        continental languages are practically sealed books, and thus the fresh
        information which they are well able to contribute is not elicited. It
        is hoped that the translation of this small work may meet with their
        acceptance and that of Europeans in India and elsewhere to whom the
        original is either unknown or who do not find a foreign language so easy
        to read as their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The translation has been prepared under my supervision, and with a few
        short footnotes. Professor B&uuml;hler's long note on the authenticity
        of the Jaina tradition I have transferred to an appendix (p. 48)
        incorporating with it a summary of what he subsequently expanded in
        proof of his thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Colebrooke's account of the Tirthan&#775;karas reverenced by the
        Jainas, but little has been added since its publication in the ninth
        volume of the <i>Asiatic Researches</i>; and as these are the centre of
        their worship, always represented in their temples, and surrounded by
        attendant figures,--I have ventured to add a somewhat fuller account of
        them and a summary of the general mythology of the sect, which may be
        useful to the archaeologist and the student of their iconography.

        The <i>Jaina</i> sect is a religious society of modern India, at
        variance to Brahmanism, and possesses undoubted claims on the interest
        of all friends of Indian history. This claim is based partly on the
        peculiarities of their doctrines and customs, which present several
        resemblances to those of Buddhism, but, above all, on the fact that it
        was founded in the same period as the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Larger and smaller communities of <i>Jainas</i> or <i>Arhata</i>,--that
        is followers of the prophet, who is generally called simply the <i>Jina</i>--'the
        conqueror of the world',--or the <i>Arhat</i>--'the holy one',--are to
        be found in almost every important Indian town, particularly among the
        merchant class. In some provinces of the West and North-west, in Gujar&acirc;t,
        R&acirc;jput&acirc;na, and the Panj&acirc;b, as also in the Dravidian
        districts in the south,--especially in Kanara,--they are numerous; and,
        owing to the influence of their wealth, they take a prominent place.
        They do not, however, present a compact mass, but are divided into two
        rival branches--the <i>Digambara</i> and <i>&#346;vet&acirc;mbara</i>[<a
        href="#b1_fn1" id="b1_fm1_">1</a>] --each of which is split up into
        several subdivisions. The Digambara, that is, "those whose robe is the
        atmosphere," owe their name to the circumstance that they regard
        absolute nudity as the indispensable sign of holiness, [<a href="#b1_fn2"
        id="b1_fm2_">2</a>] --though the advance of civilization has compelled
        them to depart from the practice of their theory. The &#346;vet&acirc;mbara,
        that is, "they who are clothed in white"--do not claim this doctrine,
        but hold it as possible that the holy ones, who clothe themselves, may
        also attain the highest goal. They allow, however, that the founder of
        the Jaina religion and his first disciples disdained to wear clothes.
        They are divided, not only by this quarrel, but also by differences
        about dogmas and by a different literature. The separation must
        therefore be of old standing. Tradition, too, upholds this--though the
        dates given do not coincide. From inscriptions it is certain that the
        split occurred before the first century of our era. [<a href="#b1_fn3"
        id="b1_fm3_">3</a>] Their opposing opinions are manifested in the fact
        that they do not allow each other the right of intermarriage or of
        eating at the same table,--the two chief marks of social equality. In
        spite of the age of the schism, and the enmity that divides the two
        branches, they are at one as regards the arrangement of their
        communities, doctrine, discipline, and cult,--at least in the more
        important points; and, thus, one can always speak of the Jaina religion
        as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The characteristic feature of this religion is its claim to
        universality, which it holds in common with Buddhism, and in opposition
        to Brahmanism. It also declares its object to be to lead all men to
        salvation, and to open its arms--not only to the noble Aryan, but also
        to the low-born &#346;&ucirc;dra and even to the alien, deeply despised
        in India, the Mlechcha. [<a href="#b1_fn4" id="b1_fm4_">4</a>] As their
        doctrine, like Buddha's, is originally a philosophical ethical system
        intended for ascetics, the disciples, like the Buddhists, are, divided
        into ecclesiastics and laity. At the head stands an order of ascetics,
        originally Nirgrantha "they, who are freed from all bands," now usually
        called Yatis--"Ascetics", or S&acirc;dhus--"Holy", which, among the
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbara also admits women, [<a href="#b1_fn5" id="b1_fm5_">5</a>]
        and under them the general community of the Up&acirc;saka "the
        Worshippers", or the &#346;r&acirc;vaka, "the hearers".
      </p>
      <p>
        The ascetics alone are able to penetrate into the truths which Jina
        teaches, to follow his rules and to attain to the highest reward which
        he promises. The laity, however, who do not dedicate themselves to the
        search after truth, and cannot renounce the life of the world, still
        find a refuge in Jainism. It is allowed to them as hearers to share its
        principles, and to undertake duties, which are a faint copy of the
        demands made on the ascetics. Their reward is naturally less. He who
        remains in the world cannot reach the highest goal, but he can still
        tread the way which leads to it. Like all religions of the Hind&ucirc;s
        founded on philosophical speculation, Jainism sees this highest goal in
        <i>Nirv&acirc;na</i> or <i>Moksha</i>, the setting free of the
        individual from the <i>Sam&#775;s&acirc;ra</i>,--the revolution of birth
        and death. The means of reaching it are to it, as to Buddhism, the three
        Jewels--the right Faith, the right Knowledge, and the right Walk. By the
        right Faith it understands the full surrender of himself to the teacher,
        the Jina, the firm conviction that he alone has found the way of
        salvation, and only with him is protection and refuge to be found. Ask
        who Jina is, and the Jaina will give exactly the same answer as the
        Buddhist with respect to Buddha. He is originally an erring man, bound
        with the bonds of the world, who,--not by the help of a teacher, nor by
        the revelation of the Vedas--which, he declares, are corrupt--but by his
        own power, has attained to omniscience and freedom, and out of pity for
        suffering mankind preaches and declares the way of salvation, which he
        has found. Because he has conquered the world and the enemies in the
        human heart, he is called Jina "the Victor", Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, "the
        great hero"; because he possesses the highest knowledge, he is called
        Sarvaj&ntilde;a or Kevalin, the "omniscient", Buddha, the "enlightened";
        because he has freed himself from the world he receives the names of
        Mukta "the delivered one", Siddha and Tath&acirc;gata, "the perfected",
        Arhat "the holy one"; and as the proclaimer of the doctrine, he is the T&icirc;rthakara
        "the finder of the ford", through the ocean of the <i>Sam&#775;s&acirc;ra</i>.
        In these epithets, applied to the founder of their doctrine, the Jainas
        agree almost entirely with the Buddhists, as the likeness of his
        character to that of Buddha would lead us to expect. They prefer,
        however, to use the names Jina and Arhat, while the Buddhists prefer to
        speak of Buddha as Tath&acirc;gata or Sugata. The title T&icirc;rthakara
        is peculiar to the Jainas. Among the Buddhists it is a designation for
        false teachers. [<a href="#b1_fn6" id="b1_fm6_">6</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jaina says further, however, that there was more than one Jina. Four
        and twenty have, at long intervals, appeared and have again and again
        restored to their original purity the doctrines darkened by evil
        influences. They all spring from noble, warlike tribes. Only in such,
        not among the low Br&acirc;hman&#803;s, can a Jina see the light of the
        world. The first Jina R&#803;i&#784;shabha,--more than 100 billion
        oceans of years ago,--periods of unimaginable length, [<a href="#b1_fn7"
        id="b1_fm7_">7</a>] --was born as the son of a king of Ayodhy&acirc; and
        lived eight million four hundred thousand years. The intervals between
        his successors and the durations of their lives became shorter and
        shorter. Between the twenty third, P&acirc;r&#347;va and the twenty
        fourth Vardham&acirc;na, were only 250 years, and the age of the latter
        is given as only seventy-two years. He appeared, according to some, in
        the last half of the sixth century, according to others in the first
        half of the fifth century B.C. He is of course the true, historical
        prophet of the Jainas and it is in his doctrine, that the Jainas should
        believe. The dating back of the origin of the Jaina religion again,
        agrees with the pretensions of the Buddhists, who recognise twenty-five
        Buddhas who taught the same system one after the other. Even with
        Brahmanism, it seems to be in some distant manner connected, for the
        latter teaches in its cosmogony, the successive appearance of Demiurges,
        and wise men--the fourteen Manus, who, at various periods helped to
        complete the work of creation and proclaimed the Brahmanical law. These
        Brahmanical ideas may possibly have given rise to the doctrines of the
        twenty-five Buddhas and twenty-four Jinas, [<a href="#b1_fn8"
        id="b1_fm8_">8</a>] which, certainly, are later additions in both
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The undoubted and absolutely correct comprehension of the nine truths
        which the Jina gives expression to, or of the philosophical system which
        the Jina taught, represents the second Jewel--the true Knowledge. Its
        principal features are shortly as follows. [<a href="#b1_fn9"
        id="b1_fm9_">9</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The world (by which we are to understand, not only the visible, but also
        imaginary continents depicted with the most extravagant fancy, heavens
        and hells of the Brahmanical Cosmology, extended by new discoveries) is
        uncreated. It exists, without ruler, only by the power of its elements,
        and is everlasting. The elements of the world are six substances--souls,
        <i>Dharma</i> or moral merit, <i>Adharma</i> or sin, space, time,
        particles of matter. From the union of the latter spring four
        elements--earth, fire, water, wind--and further, bodies and all other
        appearances of the world of sense and of the supernatural worlds. The
        forms of the appearances are mostly unchangeable. Only the bodies of men
        and their age increase or decrease in consequence of the greater or less
        influence of sin or merit, during immeasurably long periods,--the <i>Avasarpin&#803;i</i>
        and the <i>Utsarpin&#803;i</i>. Souls are, each by itself, independent,
        real existences whose foundation is pure intelligence, and who possess
        an impulse to action. In the world they are always chained to bodies.
        The reason of this confinement is that they give themselves up to the
        stress of activity, to passions, to influences of the senses and objects
        of the mind, or attach themselves to a false belief. The deeds which
        they perform in the bodies are <i>Karman</i>, merit and sin. This drives
        them--when one body has passed away, according to the conditions of its
        existence--into another, whose quality depends on the character of the
        <i>Karman</i>, and will be determined especially by the last thoughts
        springing from it before death. Virtue leads to the heavens of the gods
        or to birth among men in pure and noble races. Sin consigns the souls to
        the lower regions, in the bodies of animals, in plants, even into masses
        of lifeless matter. For--according to the Jaina doctrine--souls exist
        not only in organic structures, but also in apparently dead masses, in
        stones, in lumps of earth, in drops of water, in fire and in wind.
        Through union with bodies the nature of the soul is affected. In the
        mass of matter the light of its intelligence is completely concealed; it
        loses consciousness, is immovable, and large or small, according to the
        dimensions of its abode. In organic structures it is always conscious;
        it depends however, on the nature of the same, whether it is movable or
        immovable and possessed of five, four, three, two, or one organ of
        sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bondage of souls, if they inhabit a human body, can be abolished by
        the suppression of the causes which lead to their confinement and by the
        destruction of the <i>Karman</i>. The suppression of the causes is
        accomplished by overcoming the inclination to be active and the
        passions, by the control of the senses, and by steadfastly holding to
        the right faith. In this way will be hindered the addition of new <i>Karman</i>,
        new merit or new guilt. The destruction of <i>Karman</i> remaining from
        previous existences can be brought about either spontaneously by the
        exhaustion of the supply or by asceticism. In the latter case the final
        state is the attainment to a knowledge which penetrates the universe, to
        <i>Kevala, J&ntilde;&acirc;na</i> and <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i> or <i>Moksha</i>:
        full deliverance from all bonds. These goals may be reached even while
        the soul is still in its body. If however the body is destroyed then the
        soul wanders into the "No-World" <i>(al&ocirc;ka)</i> as the Jain says,
        i.e. into the heaven of Jina 'the delivered', lying outside the world. [<a
        href="#b1_fn10" id="b1_fm10_">10</a>] There it continues eternally in
        its pure intellectual nature. Its condition is that of perfect rest
        which nothing disturbs. These fundamental ideas are carried out in the
        particulars with a subtilness and fantasy unexampled, even in subtile
        and fantastic India, in a scholarly style, and defended by the <i>sy&acirc;dv&acirc;da</i>--the
        doctrine of "It may be so",--a mode of reasoning which makes it possible
        to assert and deny the existence of one and the same thing. If this be
        compared with the other Indian systems, it stands nearer the Br&acirc;hman&#803;
        than the Buddhist, with which it has the acceptance in common of only
        four, not five elements. Jainism touches all the Br&acirc;hman&#803;
        religions and Buddhism in its cosmology and ideas of periods, and it
        agrees entirely with regard to the doctrines of <i>Karman</i>, of the
        bondage, and the deliverance of souls. Atheism, the view that the world
        was not created, is common to it with Buddhism and the S&acirc;n&#775;khya
        philosophy. Its psychology approaches that of the latter in that both
        believe in the existence of innumerable independent souls. But the
        doctrine of the activity of souls and their distribution into masses of
        matter is in accordance with the Ved&acirc;nta, according to which the
        principle of the soul penetrates every thing existing. In the further
        development of the soul doctrine, the conceptions 'individual soul' and
        'living being' to which the Jaina and the Br&acirc;hman&#803; give the
        same name,--<i>j&icirc;va</i>, seem to become confounded. The Jaina idea
        of space and time as real substances is also found in the Vai&#347;eshika
        system. In placing <i>Dharma</i> and <i>Adharma</i> among substances
        Jainism stands alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third jewel, the right Walk which the Jaina ethics contains, has its
        kernel in the five great oaths which the Jaina ascetic takes on his
        entrance into the order. He promises, just as the Br&acirc;hman&#803;
        penitent, and almost in the same words, not to hurt, not to speak
        untruth, to appropriate nothing to himself without permission, to
        preserve chastity, and to practice self-sacrifice. The contents of these
        simple rules become most extraordinarily extended on the part of the
        Jainas by the insertion of five clauses, in each of which are three
        separate active instruments of sin, in special relation to thoughts,
        words, and deeds. Thus, concerning the oath not to hurt, on which the
        Jaina lays the greatest emphasis: it includes not only the intentional
        killing or hurting of living beings, plants, or the souls existing in
        dead matter, it requires also the utmost carefulness in the whole manner
        of life, in all movements, a watchfulness over all functions of the body
        by which anything living might be hurt. [<a href="#b1_fn11" id="b1_fm11_">11</a>]
        It demands finally strict watch over the heart and tongue, and the
        avoidance of all thoughts and words which might lead to dispute and
        quarrel and thereby to harm. In like manner the rule of sacrifice means
        not only that the ascetic has no house or possessions, it teaches also
        that a complete unconcern toward agreeable and disagreeable impressions
        is necessary, as also the sacrifice of every attachment to anything
        living or dead. [<a href="#b1_fn12" id="b1_fm12_">12</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside the conscientious observance of these rules, Tapas--Asceticism,
        is most important for the right walk of those, who strive to attain <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>.
        Asceticism is inward as well as outward. The former is concerned with
        self-discipline, the cleansing and purifying of the mind. It embraces
        repentance of sin, confession of the same to the teacher, and penance
        done for it, humility before teachers and all virtuous ones, and the
        service of the same, the study and teaching of the faith or holy
        writing, pious meditations on the misery of the world, the impurity of
        the body, etc. and lastly, the stripping off of every thing pertaining
        to the world. On the other hand, under the head of exterior Asceticism,
        the Jaina understands temperance, begging, giving up all savoury food,
        different kinds of self-mortification such as sitting in unnatural and
        wearying positions, hindering the action of the organs, especially by
        fasts, which, under certain circumstances may be continued to
        starvation. Voluntary death by the withdrawal of nourishment is,
        according to the strict doctrine of the Digambara, necessary for all
        ascetics, who have reached the highest step of knowledge. The Kevalin,
        they say, eats no longer. The milder &#346;vet&acirc;mbara do not demand
        this absolutely, but regard it, as a sure entrance to <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>.
        In order, however, that this death may bear its fruits, the ascetic must
        keep closely to the directions for it, otherwise he merely lengthens the
        number of rebirths. [<a href="#b1_fn13" id="b1_fm13_">13</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        From these general rules follow numerous special ones, regarding the
        life of the disciple of Jina. The duty of sacrifice forces him, on
        entrance into the order, to give up his possessions and wander homeless
        in strange lands, alms-vessel in hand, and, if no other duty interferes,
        never to stay longer than one night in the same place. The rule of
        wounding nothing means that he must carry three articles with him, a
        straining cloth, for his drinking water, a broom, and a veil before his
        mouth, in order to avoid killing insects. It also commands him to avoid
        all cleansing and washing, and to rest in the four months of the rainy
        season, in which animal and plant life displays itself most abundantly.
        In order to practice asceticism, it is the rule to make this time of
        rest a period of strictest fasts, most diligent study of the holy
        writings, and deepest meditation. This duty also necessitates the
        ascetic to pluck out in the most painful manner his hair which,
        according to oriental custom, he must do away with at his
        consecration--a peculiar custom of the Jainas, which is not found among
        other penitents of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the five great vows, most of the special directions for the
        discipline of the Jain ascetic are copies, and often exaggerated copies,
        of the Br&acirc;hmanic rules for penitents. The outward marks of the
        order closely resemble those of the Sanny&acirc;sin. The life of
        wandering during eight months and the rest during the rainy season agree
        exactly; and in many other points, for example in the use of confession,
        they agree with the Buddhists. They agree with Br&acirc;hman&#803;s
        alone in ascetic self-torture, which Buddhism rejects; and specially
        characteristic is the fact that ancient Br&acirc;hmanism recommends
        starvation to its penitents as beneficial. [<a href="#b1_fn14"
        id="b1_fm14_">14</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctrine of the right way for the Jaina laity differs from that for
        the ascetics. In place of the five great vows appear mere echoes. He
        vows to avoid only serious injury to living beings, i.e. men and
        animals; only the grosser forms of untruth--direct lies; only the most
        flagrant forms of taking, what is not given, that is, theft and robbery.
        In place of the oath of chastity there is that of conjugal fidelity. In
        place of that of self-denial, the promise is not greedily to accumulate
        possessions and to be contented. To these copies are added seven other
        vows, the miscellaneous contents of which correspond to the special
        directions for the discipline of ascetics. Their object is, partly to
        bring the outward life of the laity into accordance with the Jaina
        teaching, especially with regard to the protection of living creatures
        from harm, and partly to point the heart to the highest goal. Some
        contain prohibitions against certain drinks, such as spirits; or meats,
        such as flesh, fresh butter, honey, which cannot be enjoyed without
        breaking the vow of preservation of animal life. Others limit the choice
        of businesses which the laity may enter; for example, agriculture is
        forbidden, as it involves the tearing up of the ground and the death of
        many animals, as Br&acirc;hmanism also holds. Others have to do with
        mercy and charitableness, with the preserving of inward peace, or with
        the necessity of neither clinging too much to life and its joys nor
        longing for death as the end of suffering. To the laity, however,
        voluntary starvation is also recommended as meritorious. These
        directions (as might be expected from the likeness of the circumstances)
        resemble in many points the Buddhist directions for the laity, and
        indeed are often identical with regard to the language used. Much is
        however specially in accordance with Br&acirc;hmanic doctrines. [<a
        href="#b1_fn15" id="b1_fm15_">15</a>] In practical life Jainism makes of
        its laity earnest men who exhibit a stronger trait of resignation than
        other Indians and excel in an exceptional willingness to sacrifice
        anything for their religion. It makes them also fanatics for the
        protection of animal life. Wherever they gain influence, there is an end
        of bloody sacrifices and of slaughtering and killing the larger animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The union of the laity with the order of ascetics has, naturally,
        exercised a powerful reaction on the former and its development, as well
        as on its teaching, and is followed by similar results in Jainism and
        Buddhism. Then, as regards the changes in the teaching, it is no doubt
        to be ascribed to the influence of the laity that the atheistic Jaina
        system, as well as the Buddhist, has been endowed with a cult. The
        ascetic, in his striving for <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>, endeavours to
        suppress the natural desire of man to worship higher powers. In the
        worldly hearer, who does not strive after this goal exclusively, this
        could not succeed. Since the doctrine gave no other support, the
        religious feeling of the laity clung to the founder of it: Jina, and
        with him his mythical predecessors, became gods. Monuments and temples
        ornamented with their statues were built, especially at those places,
        where the prophets, according to legends, had reached their goal. To
        this is added a kind of worship, consisting of offerings of flowers and
        incense to Jina, of adoration by songs of praise in celebration of their
        entrance into <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>, of which the Jaina makes a
        great festival by solemn processions and pilgrimages to the places where
        it has been attained. [<a href="#b1_fn16" id="b1_fm16_">16</a>] This
        influence of the laity has become, in course of time, of great
        importance to Indian art, and India is indebted to it for a number of
        its most beautiful architectural monuments, such as the splendid temples
        of &Acirc;bu, Girn&acirc;r and &#346;atru&ntilde;jaya in Gujar&acirc;t.
        It has also brought about a change in the mind of the ascetics. In many
        of their hymns in honour of Jina, they appeal to him with as much
        fervour as the Br&acirc;hman&#803; to his gods; and there are often
        expressions in them, contrary, to the original teaching, ascribing to
        Jina a creative power. Indeed a Jaina description of the six principal
        systems goes so far as to number Jainism--as also Buddhism--among the
        theistic religions. [<a href="#b1_fn17" id="b1_fm17_">17</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        But in other respects also the admission of the laity has produced
        decisive changes in the life of the clergy. In the education of worldly
        communities, the ascetic--whose rules of indifference toward all and
        every thing, make him a being concentrated entirely upon himself and his
        goal--is united again to humanity and its interests. The duty of
        educating the layman and watching over his life, must of necessity
        change the wandering penitents into settled monks--who dedicate
        themselves to the care of souls, missionary activity, and the
        acquisition of knowledge, and who only now and again fulfil the duty of
        changing their place of residence. The needs of the lay communities
        required the continual presence of teachers. Even should these desire to
        change from time to time, it was yet necessary to provide a shelter for
        them. Thus the Up&acirc;&#347;raya or places of refuge, the Jaina
        monasteries came into existence, which exactly correspond to the
        Buddhist Sangh&acirc;r&acirc;ma. With the monasteries and the fixed
        residence in them appeared a fixed membership of the order, which, on
        account of the Jaina principle of unconditional obedience toward the
        teacher, proved to be much stricter than in Buddhism. On the development
        of the order and the leisure of monastic life, there followed further,
        the commencement of a literary and scientific activity. The oldest
        attempt, in this respect, limited itself to bringing their doctrine into
        fixed forms. Their results were, besides other lost works, the so-called
        <i>An&#775;ga</i>,--the members of the body of the law, which was
        perhaps originally produced in the third century B.C. Of the <i>An&#775;ga</i>
        eleven are no doubt preserved among the &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras from a
        late edition of the fifth or sixth century A.D. These works are not
        written in Sanskrit, but in a popular Pr&acirc;krit dialect: for the
        Jina, like Buddha, used the language of the people when teaching. They
        contain partly legends about the prophet and his activity as a teacher,
        partly fragments of a doctrine or attempts at systematic representations
        of the same. Though the dialect is different they present, in the form
        of the tales and in the manner of expression, a wonderful resemblance to
        the sacred writings of the Buddhists. [<a href="#b1_fn18" id="b1_fm18_">18</a>]
        The Digambaras, on the other hand, have preserved nothing of the <i>An&#775;ga</i>
        but the names. They put in their place later systematic works, also in
        Pr&acirc;krit, and assert, in vindication of their different teaching,
        that the canon of their rivals is corrupted. In the further course of
        history, however, both branches of the Jainas have, like the Buddhists,
        in their continual battles with the Br&acirc;hman&#803;s, found it
        necessary to make themselves acquainted with the ancient language of the
        culture of the latter. First the Digambara and later the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara
        began to use Sanskrit. They did not rest content with explaining their
        own teaching in Sanskrit works: they turned also to the secular sciences
        of the Br&acirc;hman&#803;s. They have accomplished so much of
        importance, in grammar, in astronomy, as well as in some branches of
        letters, that they have won respect even from their enemies, and some of
        their works are still of importance to European science. In southern
        India, where they worked among the Dravid&#803;ian tribes, they also
        advanced the development of these languages. The Kanarese literary
        language and the Tamil and Telugu rest on the foundations laid by the
        Jaina monks. This activity led them, indeed, far from their proper goal,
        but it created for them an important position in the history of
        literature and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resemblance between the Jainas and the Buddhists, which I have had
        so often cause to bring forward, suggests the question, whether they are
        to be regarded as a branch of the latter, or whether they resemble the
        Buddhists merely because, as their tradition asserts, [<a href="#b1_fn19"
        id="b1_fm19_">19</a>] they sprang from the same period and the same
        religious movement in opposition to Br&acirc;hmanism. This question, was
        formerly, and is still sometimes, answered in agreement with the first
        theory, pointing out the undoubted defects in it, to justify the
        rejection of the Jaina tradition, and even declaring it to be a late and
        intentional fabrication. In spite of this the second explanation is the
        right one, because the Buddhists themselves confirm the statements of
        the Jainas about their prophet. Old historical traditions and
        inscriptions prove the independent existence of the sect of the Jainas
        even during the first five centuries after Buddha's death, and among the
        inscriptions are some which clear the Jaina tradition not only from the
        suspicion of fraud but bear powerful witness to its honesty. [<a
        href="#b1_fn20" id="b1_fm20_">20</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The oldest canonical books of the Jaina, apart from some mythological
        additions and evident exaggerations, contain the following important
        notes on the life of their last prophet. [<a href="#b1_fn21"
        id="b1_fm21_">21</a>] Vardham&acirc;na was the younger son of Siddh&acirc;rtha
        a nobleman who belonged to the Kshatriya race, called in Sanskrit J&ntilde;&acirc;ti
        or J&ntilde;&acirc;ta, in Prakrit N&acirc;ya, and, according to the old
        custom of the Indian warrior caste, bore the name of a Br&acirc;hmanic
        family the K&acirc;&#347;yapa. His mother, who was called Tri&#347;al&acirc;,
        belonged to the family of the governors of Videha. Siddh&acirc;rtha's
        residence was Kun&#803;d&#803;apura, the Basukund of to-day, a suburb of
        the wealthy town of Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;, the modern Besarh, in
        Videha or Tirhut. [<a href="#b1_fn22" id="b1_fm22_">22</a>] Siddh&acirc;rtha
        was son-in-law to the king of Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;. Thirty years, it
        seems, Vardham&acirc;na led a worldly life in his parents' house. He
        married, and his wife Ya&#347;od&acirc; bore him a daughter Anojj&acirc;,
        who was married to a noble of the name of Jam&acirc;li, and in her turn
        had a daughter. In his thirty-first year his parents died. As they were
        followers of P&acirc;r&#347;va the twenty-third Jina, they chose,
        according to the custom of the Jainas, the death of the wise by
        starvation. Immediately after this Vardham&acirc;na determined to
        renounce the world. He got permission to take this step from his elder
        brother Nandivardhana, and the ruler of his land divided his possessions
        and became a homeless ascetic. He wandered more than twelve years, only
        resting during the rainy season, in the lands of the L&acirc;d&#803;ha,
        in Vajjabh&ucirc;mi and Subbhabh&ucirc;mi, the R&acirc;rh of to-day in
        Bengal, and learned to bear with equanimity great hardships and cruel
        ill treatment at the hands of the inhabitants of those districts.
        Besides these he imposed upon himself the severest mortifications; after
        the first year he discarded clothes and devoted himself to the deepest
        meditation. In the thirteenth year of this wandering life he believed he
        had attained to the highest knowledge and to the dignity of a holy one.
        He then appeared as a prophet, taught the Nirgrantha doctrine, a
        modification of the religion of P&acirc;r&#347;va, and organised the
        order of the Nirgrantha ascetics. From that time he bore the name of the
        venerable ascetic Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra. His career as a teacher lasted
        not quite thirty years, during which he travelled about, as formerly,
        all over the country, except during the rainy seasons. He won for
        himself numerous followers, both of the clergy and the lay class, among
        whom, however, in the fourteenth year of his period of teaching, a split
        arose--caused by his son-in-law Jam&acirc;li.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extent of his sphere of influence almost corresponds with that of
        the kingdoms of Sr&acirc;vast&icirc; or Kosala, Vidcha, Magadha, and An&#775;ga,--the
        modern Oudh, and the provinces of Tirhut and Bih&acirc;r in Western
        Bengal. Very frequently he spent the rainy season in his native place
        Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc; and in R&acirc;jagr&#803;iha. Among his
        contemporaries were, a rival teacher Gos&acirc;la the son of Mam&#775;khali--whom
        he defeated in a dispute, the King of Videha--Bhambhas&acirc;ra or
        Bibbhis&acirc;ra called Sren&#803;ika, and his sons Abhayakum&acirc;ra
        and the parricide Aj&aacute;ta&#347;atru or K&ucirc;n&#803;ika, who
        protected him or accepted his doctrine, and also the nobles of the
        Lichchhavi and Mallaki races. The town of P&acirc;p&acirc; or P&acirc;v&acirc;,
        the modern Padraona [<a href="#b1_fn23" id="b1_fm23_">23</a>] is given
        as the place of his death, where he dwelt during the rainy season of the
        last year of his life, in the house of the scribe of king Hastip&acirc;la.
        Immediately after his death, a second split took place in his community.
        [<a href="#b1_fn24" id="b1_fm24_">24</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        On consideration of this information, it immediately strikes one, that
        the scene of Vardham&acirc;na's activity is laid in the same part of
        India as Buddha laboured in, and that several of the personalities which
        play a part in the history of Buddha also appear in the Jaina legend. It
        is through the kingdoms of Kosala, Videha and Magadha, that Buddha is
        said to have wandered preaching, and their capitals &#346;r&acirc;vast&icirc;
        and R&acirc;jagr&#803;iha are just the places named, where he founded
        the largest communities. It is also told of the inhabitants of Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;
        that many turned to his doctrine. Many legends are told of his
        intercourse and friendship with Bimbis&acirc;ra or &#346;ren&#803;ika,
        king of Videha, also of the murder of the latter by his son Aj&acirc;ta&#347;atru,
        who, tortured with remorse, afterwards approached Buddha; mention is
        also made of his brother Abhayakum&acirc;ra, likewise Makkhali Gos&acirc;la
        is mentioned among Buddha's opponents and rivals. It is thus clear that
        the oldest Jaina legend makes Vardham&acirc;na a fellow countryman and
        contemporary of Buddha, and search might be suggested in the writings of
        the Buddhists for confirmation of these assumptions. Such indeed are to
        be found in no small number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the oldest works of the Singalese Canon,--which date apparently
        from the beginning of the second century after Buddha's death, or the
        fourth century B.C., and which at any rate had their final edition in
        the third,--frequently mention an opposing sect of ascetics, the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha,
        which the northern texts, written in Sanskrit, recognise among the
        opponents of Buddha, under the name Nirgrantha, whom an old <i>S&ucirc;tra</i>
        [<a href="#b1_fn25" id="b1_fm25_">25</a>] describes as "heads of
        companies of disciples and students, teachers of students, well known,
        renowned, founders of schools of doctrine, esteemed as good men by the
        multitude". Their leader is also named; he is called in P&acirc;li N&acirc;taputta,
        in Sanskrit J&ntilde;&acirc;tiputra, that is the son of J&ntilde;&acirc;ti
        or N&acirc;ta. The similarity between these words and the names of the
        family J&ntilde;&acirc;ti, J&ntilde;&acirc;ta or Naya, to which Vardham&acirc;na
        belonged is apparent. Now since in older Buddhist literature, the title
        'the son of the man of the family N. N.' is very often used instead of
        the individual's name, as for example, 'the son of the S&acirc;kiya' is
        put for Buddha-S&acirc;kiyaputta, so that it is difficult not to suppose
        that N&acirc;taputta or J&ntilde;&acirc;tiputra, the leader of the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha
        or Nirgrantha sect, is the same person as Vardham&acirc;na, the
        descendant of the J&ntilde;&acirc;ti family and founder of the
        Nirgrantha or Jaina sect. If we follow up this idea, and gather together
        the different remarks of the Buddhists about the opponents of Buddha,
        then it is apparent that his identity with Vardham&acirc;na is certain.
        A number of rules of doctrine are ascribed to him, which are also found
        among the Jainas, and some events in his life, which we have already
        found in the accounts of the life of Vardham&acirc;na, are related.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one place in the oldest part of the Singalese canon, the assertion is
        put into the mouth of Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha N&acirc;taputta, that the <i>Kiriy&acirc;v&acirc;da</i>--the
        doctrine of activity, separates his system from Buddha's teaching. We
        shall certainly recognise in this doctrine, the rule of the <i>Kiriy&acirc;</i>,
        the activity of souls, upon which Jainism places so great importance. [<a
        href="#b1_fn26" id="b1_fm26_">26</a>] Two other rules from the doctrine
        of souls are quoted in a later work, not canonical: there it is stated,
        in a collection of false doctrines which Buddha's rivals taught, that
        Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha asserts that cold water was living. Little drops of
        water contained small souls, large drops, large souls. Therefore he
        forbade his followers, the use of cold water. It is not difficult, in
        these curious rules to recognise the Jaina dogma, which asserts the
        existence of souls, even in the mass of lifeless elements of earth,
        water, fire, and wind. This also proves, that the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha
        admitted the classification of souls, so often ridiculed by the Br&acirc;hman&#803;s,
        which distinguishes between great and small. This work, like others,
        ascribes to Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha the assertion, that the so-called three
        <i>dan&#803;d&#803;a</i>--the three instruments by which man can cause
        injury to creatures--thought, word, and body, are separate active causes
        of sin. The Jaina doctrine agrees also in this case, which always
        specially represents the three and prescribes for each a special
        control. [<a href="#b1_fn27" id="b1_fm27_">27</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides these rules, which perfectly agree with one another, there are
        still two doctrines of the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha to be referred to which
        seem to, or really do, contradict the Jainas; namely, it is stated that
        N&acirc;taputta demanded from his disciples the taking of four, not as
        in Vardham&acirc;na's case, of five great vows. Although this difficulty
        may seem very important at first glance, it is, however, set aside by an
        oft repeated assertion in the Jaina works. They repeatedly say that P&agrave;r&#347;va,
        the twenty-third Jina only recognised four vows, and Vardham&acirc;na
        added the fifth. The Buddhists have therefore handed down a dogma which
        Jainism recognises. The question is merely whether they or the Jainas
        are the more to be trusted. If the latter, and it is accepted that
        Vardham&acirc;na was merely the reformer of an old religion, then the
        Buddhists must be taxed with an easily possible confusion between the
        earlier and later teachers. If, on the other hand, the Jaina accounts of
        their twenty-third prophet are regarded as mythical, and Vardham&acirc;na
        is looked upon as the true founder of the sect,--then the doctrine of
        the four vows must be ascribed to the latter, and we must accept as a
        fact that he had changed his views on this point. In any case, however,
        the Buddhist statement speaks for, rather than against, the identity of
        Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha with Jina. [<a href="#b1_fn28" id="b1_fm28_">28</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Vardham&acirc;na's system, on the other hand, is quite irreconcilable
        with N&acirc;taputta's assertion that virtue as well as sin, happiness
        as well as unhappiness is unalterably fixed for men by fate, and nothing
        in their destiny can be altered by the carrying out of the holy law. It
        is, however, just as irreconcilable with the other Buddhist accounts of
        the teaching of their opponent; because it is absolutely unimaginable,
        that the same man, who lays vows upon his followers, the object of which
        is to avoid sin, could nevertheless make virtue and sin purely dependent
        upon the disposition of fate, and preach the uselessness of carrying out
        the law. The accusation that N&acirc;taputta embraced fatalism must
        therefore be regarded as an invention and an outcome of sect hatred as
        well as of the wish to throw discredit on their opponents. [<a
        href="#b1_fn29" id="b1_fm29_">29</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The Buddhist remarks on the personality and life of N&acirc;taputta are
        still more remarkable. They say repeatedly that he laid claim to the
        dignity of an Arhat and to omniscience which the Jainas also claim for
        their prophet, whom they prefer simply to call 'the Arhat' and who
        possesses the universe-embracing '<i>Kevala</i>' knowledge. [<a
        href="#b1_fn30" id="b1_fm30_">30</a>] A history of conversions, tells us
        further that N&acirc;taputta and his disciples disdained to cover their
        bodies; we are told just the same of Vardham&acirc;na. [<a
        href="#b1_fn31" id="b1_fm31_">31</a>] A story in the oldest part of the
        Singalese canon gives an interesting and important instance of his
        activity in teaching. Buddha, so the legend runs, once came to the town
        Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc;, the seat of the Kshatriya of the Lichchhavi
        race. His name, his law, his community were highly praised by the nobles
        of the Lichchhavi in the senate-house. S&icirc;ha, their general, who
        was a follower of the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha, became anxious to know the
        great teacher. He went to his master N&acirc;taputta, who happened to be
        staying in Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc; just then, and asked permission to
        pay the visit. Twice N&acirc;taputta refused him. Then S&icirc;ha
        determined to disobey him. He sought Buddha out, heard his teaching and
        was converted by him. In order to show his attachment to his new teacher
        he invited Buddha and his disciples to eat with him. On the acceptance
        of the invitation, S&icirc;ha commanded his servants to provide flesh in
        honour of the occasion. This fact came to the ears of the followers of
        the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha. Glad to have found an occasion to damage
        Buddha, they hurried in great numbers through the town, crying out, that
        S&icirc;ha had caused a great ox to be killed for Buddha's
        entertainment; that Buddha had eaten of the flesh of the animal although
        he knew it had been killed on his account, and was, therefore guilty of
        the death of the animal. The accusation was brought to Siha's notice and
        was declared by him to be a calumny. Buddha, however preached a sermon
        after the meal, in which he forbade his disciples to partake of the
        flesh of such animals as had been killed on their account. The legend
        also corroborates the account in the Jaina works, according to which
        Vardham&acirc;na often resided in Vai&#347;&acirc;l&icirc; and had a
        strong following in that town. It is probably related to show that his
        sect was stricter, as regards the eating of flesh, than the Buddhists, a
        point, which again agrees with the statutes of the Jainas. [<a
        href="#b1_fn32" id="b1_fm32_">32</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        The account of N&acirc;taputta's death is still more important. "Thus I
        heard it", says an old book of the Singalese canon, the <i>S&acirc;mag&acirc;ma
        Sutta</i>, "once the Venerable one lived in S&acirc;mag&acirc;ma in the
        land of the S&acirc;kya. At that time, however, certainly the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha
        N&acirc;taputta had died in P&acirc;v&acirc;. After his death the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha
        wandered about disunited, separate, quarrelling, fighting, wounding each
        other with words." [<a href="#b1_fn33" id="b1_fm33_">33</a>] Here we
        have complete confirmation of the statement of the Jaina canon as to the
        place where Vardham&acirc;na entered <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>, as well
        as of the statement that a schism occurred immediately after his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        The harmony between the Buddhist and Jaina tradition, as to the person
        of the head of the Nirgrantha is meanwhile imperfect. It is disturbed by
        the description of N&acirc;taputta as a member of the Br&acirc;hmanic
        sect of the &Acirc;gnive&#347;y&acirc;yana, whilst Vardham&acirc;na
        belonged to the K&acirc;&#347;yapa. The point is however so
        insignificant, that an error on the part of the Buddhists is easily
        possible. [<a href="#b1_fn34" id="b1_fm34_">34</a>] It is quite to be
        understood that perfect exactness is not to be expected among the
        Buddhists or any other sect in describing the person of a hated enemy.
        Enmity and scorn, always present, forbid that. The most that one can
        expect is that the majority and most important of the facts given may
        agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This condition is undoubtedly fulfilled in the case on hand. It cannot,
        therefore be denied, that, in spite of this difference, in spite also of
        the absurdity of one article of the creed ascribed to him, Vardham&acirc;na
        J&ntilde;&acirc;tiputra, the founder of the Nirgrantha--or Jaina
        community is none other than Buddha's rival. From Buddhist accounts in
        their canonical works as well as in other books, it may be seen that
        this rival was a dangerous and influential one, and that even in
        Buddha's time his teaching had spread considerably. Their legends about
        conversions from other sects very often make mention of Nirgrantha
        sectarians, whom Buddha's teaching or that of his disciples had
        alienated from their faith. Also they say in their descriptions of other
        rivals of Buddha, that these, in order to gain esteem, copied the
        Nirgrantha and went unclothed, or that they were looked upon by the
        people as Nirgrantha holy ones, because they happened to have lost their
        clothes. Such expressions would be inexplicable if Vardham&acirc;na's
        community had not become of great importance. [<a href="#b1_fn35"
        id="b1_fm35_">35</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        This agrees with several remarks in the Buddhist chronicles, which
        assert the existence of the Jainas in different districts of India
        during the first century after Buddha's death. In the memoirs of the
        Chinese Buddhist and pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang, who visited India in the
        beginning of the seventh century of our era, is to be found an extract
        from the ancient annals of Magadha, which proves the existence of the
        Nirgrantha or Jainas in their original home from a very early time. [<a
        href="#b1_fn36" id="b1_fm36_">36</a>] This extract relates to the
        building of the great monastry at N&acirc;land&acirc;, the high school
        of Buddhism in eastern India, which was founded shortly after Buddha's
        <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>, and mentions incidentally that a Nirgrantha
        who was a great astrologer and prophet had prophesied the future success
        of the new building. At almost as early a period the <i>Mah&acirc;van[g]sa</i>,
        composed in the fifth century A.D., fixes the appearance of the
        Nirgrantha in the island of Ceylon. It is said that the king Pan&#803;d&#803;uk&acirc;bhaya,
        who ruled in the beginning of the second century after Buddha, from
        367-307 B.C. built a temple and a monastery for two Nirgranthas. The
        monastery is again mentioned in the same work in the account of the
        reign of a later king Vat&#803;t&#803;&acirc;g&acirc;mini, cir. 38-10
        B.C. It is related that Vat&#803;t&#803;&acirc;g&acirc;mini being
        offended by the inhabitants, caused it to be destroyed after it had
        existed during the reigns of twenty one kings, and erected a Buddhist
        San&#775;gh&acirc;r&acirc;ma in its place. The latter piece of
        information is found also in the <i>D&icirc;pavan[g]sa</i> of more than
        a century earlier. [<a href="#b1_fn37" id="b1_fm37_">37</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        None of these works can indeed be looked upon as a truly historical
        source. There are, even in those paragraphs which treat of the oldest
        history after Buddha's death, proofs enough that they simply hand down a
        faulty historical tradition. In spite of this, their statements on the
        Nirgrantha, cannot be denied a certain weight, because they are closely
        connected on the one side with the Buddhist canon, and on the other they
        agree with the indisputable sources of history, which relate to a
        slightly later period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first authentic information on Vardham&acirc;na's sect is given by
        our oldest inscriptions, the religious edicts of the Maurya king A&#347;oka,
        who, according to tradition was anointed in the year 219 after Buddha's
        death, and--as the reference to his Grecian contemporaries, Antiochos,
        Magas, Alexander, Ptolemaeus and Antigonas confirms,--ruled, during the
        second half of the third century B.C. over the whole of India with the
        exception of the Dekhan. This prince interested himself not only in
        Buddhism, which he professed in his later years, but he took care, in a
        fatherly way, as he repeatedly relates, of all other religious sects in
        his vast kingdom. In the fourteenth year of his reign, he appointed
        officials, called law-superintendents, whose duty it was to watch over
        the life of the different communities, to settle their quarrels, to
        control the distribution of their legacies and pious gifts. He says of
        them in the second part of the seventh 'pillar' edict, which he issued
        in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, "My superintendents are occupied
        with various charitable matters, they are also engaged with all sects of
        ascetics and householders; I have so arranged that they will also be
        occupied with the affairs of the <i>Sam&#775;gha</i>; likewise I have
        arranged that they will be occupied with the &Acirc;j&icirc;vika Br&acirc;hman&#803;s;
        I have arranged it that they will also be occupied with the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha".
        [<a href="#b1_fn38" id="b1_fm38_">38</a>] The word <i>Sam&#775;gha</i>
        serves here as usual for the Buddhist monks. The &Acirc;j&iacute;vikas,
        whose name completely disappears later, are often named in the sacred
        writings of the Buddhists and the Jainas as an influential sect. They
        enjoyed the special favour of A&#347;oka, who, as other inscriptions
        testify, caused several caves at Bar&agrave;bar to be made into
        dwellings for their ascetics. [<a href="#b1_fn39" id="b1_fm39_">39</a>]
        As in the still older writings of the Buddhist canon, the name Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha
        here can refer only to the followers of Vardham&acirc;na. As they are
        here, along with the other two favourites, counted worthy of special
        mention, we may certainly conclude that they were of no small importance
        at the time. Had they been without influence and of small numbers A&#347;oka
        would hardly have known of them, or at least would not have singled them
        out from the other numerous nameless sects of which he often speaks. It
        may also be supposed that they were specially numerous in their old
        home, as A&#347;oka's capital P&acirc;t&#803;aliputra lay in this land.
        Whether they spread far over these boundaries, cannot be ascertained.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand we possess two documents from the middle of the next
        century which prove that they advanced into south-eastern India as far
        as Kalin&#775;ga. These are the inscriptions at Khan&#803;d&#803;agiri
        in Orissa, of the great King Kh&acirc;ravela and his first wife, who
        governed the east coast of India from the year 152 to 165 of the Maurya
        era that is, in the first half of second century B.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        The larger inscription, unfortunately very much disfigured, contains an
        account of the life of Kh&acirc;ravela from his childhood till the
        thirteenth year of his reign. It begins with an appeal to the Arhat and
        Siddha, which corresponds to the beginning of the five-fold form of
        homage still used among the Jainas, and mentions the building of temples
        in honour of the Arhat as well as an image of the first Jina, which was
        taken away by a hostile king. The second and smaller inscription asserts
        that Kh&acirc;ravela's wife caused a cave to be prepared for the
        ascetics of Kalinga, "who believed on the Arhat." [<a href="#b1_fn40"
        id="b1_fm40_">40</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        From a somewhat later period, as the characters show, from the first
        century B.C. comes a dedicatory inscription which has been found far to
        the west of the original home of the Jainas, in Mathur&agrave; on the
        Jamn&acirc;. It tells of the erection of a small temple in honour of the
        Arhat Vardham&acirc;na, also of the dedication of seats for the
        teachers, a cistern, and a stone table. The little temple, it says,
        stood beside the temple of the guild of tradesmen, and this remark
        proves, that Mathur&acirc;, which, according to the tradition of the
        Jainas, was one of the chief scats of their religion, possessed a
        community of Jainas even before the time of this inscription. [<a
        href="#b1_fn41" id="b1_fm41_">41</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        A large member of dedicatory inscriptions have come to light, which are
        dated from the year 5 to 98 of the era of the Indo-Skythian kings,
        Kanishka, Huvishka, and V&acirc;sudeva (Bazodeo) and therefore belong at
        latest to the end of the first and to the second century A.D. They are
        all on the pedestals of statues, which are recognisable partly by the
        special mention of the names of Vardham&acirc;na and the Arhat Mah&acirc;v&iacute;ra,
        partly by absolute nudity and other marks. They show, that the Jaina
        community continued to flourish in Mathur&acirc; and give besides
        extraordinarily important information, as I found in a renewed research
        into the ancient history of the sect. In a number of them, the
        dedicators of the statues give not only their own names, but also those
        of the religious teachers to whose communities they belonged. Further,
        they give these teachers their official titles, still used among the
        Jainas: <i>v&acirc;chaka</i>, 'teacher', and <i>gan&#803;in</i>, 'head
        of a school'. Lastly they specify the names of the schools to which the
        teachers belonged, and those of their subdivisions. The schools are
        called, <i>gan&#803;a</i>, 'companies'; the subdivisions, <i>kula</i>,
        'families' and <i>&#347;&acirc;kh&agrave;</i>, 'branches'. Exactly the
        same division into <i>gan&#803;a, &#347;&acirc;kh&agrave;</i>, and <i>kula</i>
        is found in a list in one of the canonical works, of the &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras,
        the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, which gives the number of the patriarchs
        and of the schools founded by them, and it is of the highest importance,
        that, in spite of mutilation and faulty reproduction of the
        inscriptions, nine of the names, which appear in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        are recognisable in them, of which part agree exactly, part, through the
        fault of the stone-mason or wrong reading by the copyist, are somewhat
        defaced. According to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, Sushita, the ninth
        successor to Vardham&acirc;na In the position of patriarch, together
        with his companion Supratibuddha, founded the 'Kod&#803;iya' or 'Kautika
        <i>gan&#803;a</i>, which split up into four '<i>s&acirc;kh&agrave;</i>,
        and four '<i>kula</i>'. Inscription No. 4. which is dated in the year 9
        of the king Kanishka or 87. A.D. (?) gives us a somewhat ancient form of
        the name of the <i>gan&#803;a Kot&#803;iya</i> and that of one of its
        branches exactly corresponding to the <i>Vairi &#347;&agrave;kh&acirc;</i>.
        Mutilated or wrongly written, the first word occurs also in inscriptions
        Nos. 2, 6 and 9 as <i>koto-, ket&#803;t&#803;iya</i>, and <i>ka</i> ...,
        the second in No. 6 as <i>Vor&acirc;</i>. One of the families of this <i>gan&#803;a</i>,
        the <i>V&acirc;n&#803;iya kula</i> is mentioned in No. 6, and perhaps in
        No. 4. The name of a second, the <i>Pra&#347;nav&agrave;han&#803;aka</i>,
        seems to have appeared in No. 19. The last inscription mentions also
        another branch of the Kot&#803;iya gan&#803;a, the <i>Majhim&acirc; s&acirc;kh&acirc;</i>,
        which, according to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra,</i> was founded by
        Priyagantha the second disciple of Susthita. <a id="p44_"></a>Two still
        older schools which, according to tradition, sprang from the fourth
        disciple of the eighth patriarch, along with some of their divisions
        appear in inscriptions Nos. 20 and 10. These are the <i>Aryya-Udehik&icirc;ya
        gan&#803;a</i>, called the school of the &Acirc;rya-Rohan&#803;a in the
        <i> Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, to which belonged the <i>Parih&acirc;saka kula</i>
        and the <i> P&ucirc;rnap&acirc;trik&acirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;,</i>
        as also the <i>Char&acirc;n&#803;a gan&#803;a</i> with the <i>Pr&icirc;tidharmika
        kula.</i> Each of these names is, however, somewhat mutilated by one or
        more errata in writing. [<a href="#b1_fn42" id="b1_fm42_">42</a>] The
        statements in the inscriptions about the teachers and their schools are
        of no small importance in themselves for the history of the Jainas. If,
        at the end of the first century A.D.(?) many separate schools of Jaina
        ascetics existed, a great age and lively activity, as well as great care
        as regards the traditions of the sect, may be inferred. The agreement of
        the inscriptions with the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> leads still further
        however: it proves on the one side that the Jainas of Mathur&acirc; were
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbara, and that the schism, which split the sect into
        two rival branches occurred long before the beginning of our era. On the
        other hand it proves that the tradition of the Svet&acirc;mbara really
        contains ancient historic elements, and by no means deserves to be
        looked upon with distrust. It is quite probable that, like all
        traditions, it is not altogether free from error. But it can no longer
        be declared to be the result of a later intentional misrepresentation,
        made in order to conceal the dependence of Jainism on Buddhism. It is no
        longer possible to dispute its authenticity with regard to those points
        which are confirmed by independent statements of other sects, and to
        assert, for example, that the Jaina account of the life of Vardham&acirc;na,
        which agrees with the statements of the Buddists, proves nothing as
        regards the age of Jainism because in the late fixing of the canon of
        the &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras in the sixth century after Christ it may have
        been drawn from Buddhist works. Such an assertion which, under all
        circumstances, is a bold one, becomes entirely untenable when it is
        found that the tradition in question states correctly facts which lie
        not quite three centuries distant from Vardham&acirc;na's time, and that
        the sect, long before the first century of our era kept strict account
        of their internal affairs. [<a href="#b1_fn43" id="b1_fm43_">43</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately the testimony to the ancient history of the Jainas, so far
        as made known by means of inscriptions, terminates here. Interesting as
        it would be to follow the traces of their communities in the later
        inscriptions, which become so numerous from the fifth century A.D.
        onwards and in the description of his travels by Hiuen Tsiang, who found
        them spread through the whole of India and even beyond its boundaries,
        it would be apart from our purpose. The documents quoted suffice,
        however, to confirm the assertion that during the first five centuries
        after Buddha's death both the statements of Buddhist tradition and real
        historical sources give evidence to the existence of the Jainas as an
        important religious community independent of Buddhism, and that there
        are among the historical sources some which entirely clear away the
        suspicion that the tradition of the Jainas themselves is intentionally
        falsified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage gained for Indian history from the conclusion that Jainism
        and Buddhism are two contemporary sects--having arisen in the same
        district,--is no small one. First, this conclusion shows that the
        religious movement of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. in eastern
        India must have been a profound one. If not only one, but certainly two,
        and perhaps more reformers, appeared at the same time, preaching
        teachers, who opposed the existing circumstances in the same manner, and
        each of whom gained no small number of followers for their doctrines,
        the desire to overthrow the Brahmanical order of things must have been
        generally and deeply felt. This conclusion shows then that the
        transformation of the religious life in India was not merely the work of
        a religious community. Many strove to attain this object although
        separated from one another. It is now recognisable, though
        preliminarily, in one point only, that the religious history of India
        from the fifth century B.C. to the eighth or ninth A.D. was not made up
        of the fight between Brahmanism and Buddhism alone. This conclusion
        allows us, lastly, to hope that the thorough investigation of the oldest
        writings of the Jainas and their relations with Buddhism on the one hand
        and with Brahmanism on the other will afford many important ways of
        access to a more exact knowledge concerning the religious ideas which
        prevailed in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., and to the
        establishment of the boundaries of originality between the different
        systems.

        APPENDIX A.

      <p>
        Copies of the mutilated inscriptions referred to, were published by
        General Sir A. Cunningham in his <i>Archaeological Survey Reports</i>,
        vol. III, plates xiii-xv. Unfortunately they have been presented from
        'copies' and are therefore full of errors, which are due for the most
        part, doubtless, to the copyist and not to the sculptor. It is not
        difficult, however, in most cases under consideration here, to restore
        the correct reading. Usually only vowel signs are omitted or misread
        and, here, and there, consonants closely resembling one another as <i>va</i>
        and <i>cha, va</i>, and <i>dha, ga</i> and <i>&#347;a, la</i> and <i>na</i>
        are interchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formulae of the inscriptions are almost universally the same. First
        comes the date, then follows the name of a reverend teacher, next, the
        mention of the school and the subdivision of it to which he belonged.
        Then the persons, who dedicated the statues are named (mostly women),
        and who belonged to the community of the said teacher. The description
        of the gift forms the conclusion. The dialect of the inscriptions shows
        that curious mixture of Sanskr&#803;&#301;t and Pr&acirc;kr&#803;&#301;t
        which is found in almost all documents of the Indo-Skythian kings, and
        whichas Dr. Hoernle was the first to recognise--was one of the literary
        languages of northern and northwestern India during the first centuries
        before and after the commencement of our era.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the calculation of dates, I use the favourite starting point for the
        era of the Indo-Skythian kings, which unfortunately, is not certainly
        determined, and assume that it is identical with the <i>Saka</i> era of
        78-&frac14; A.D. The rule of these princes could not have fallen later:
        in my opinion it was somewhat earlier [<a href="#b1_fn44" id="b1_fm44_">44</a>]
        I give here transcripts and restorations of such inscriptions as mention
        Jaina schools or titles.

        The lacuna in line 2, after <i>Dattilasya</i>, probably contained the
        word <i>duhituye</i> or <i>dh&ucirc;tuye</i> and part of a male name of
        which only the letter <i>vi</i> is visible. In l. 3, possibly <i>kot&#803;habiniye</i>
        is to be read instead of <i>kot&#803;hubikiye</i>. As there is room for
        one more letter at the end of the line, I propose to read <i>m&acirc;tuye</i>.
        In l. 5, <i>Din&acirc;ye</i> would stand for <i>Datt&acirc;y&acirc;h[postvocalic]</i>
        and be the genitive of a female name <i>Dinn&acirc;</i> or <i>Datt&acirc;</i>,
        which has been shortened <i>bh&acirc;m&acirc;vat</i>. There can be no
        doubt that the word <i>&#347;r&icirc;</i>, or <i>&#347;iri</i>, which is
        required, has stood before <i>Vardham&acirc;na</i>. With these
        restorations the translation is as follows:

        2. With the inscription No. 6 of the year 20, No. 4 (plate xiii) agrees;
        it was also found on a Jaina pedestal. With better readings from a

        which I have no rubbings, the following emendations,--l. 1, <i>V&acirc;niyato

      </div>
      <p>
        If we now turn to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>, we find that Sut&#803;t&#803;hiya
        or Susthita, the eighth successor of Vardham&acirc;na, founded the Kaut&#803;ika
        or Kod&#803;iya gan&#803;a, which split up into four &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;s
        and four kulas. The third of the former was the Vajr&icirc; or Vair&icirc;,
        and the third of the latter was the V&acirc;n&#803;&icirc;ya or V&acirc;n&#803;ijja.
        It is evident that the names of the <i>gan&#803;a, kula</i>, and <i>&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;</i>
        agree with those mentioned in the two inscriptions, Kot&#803;iya being a
        somewhat older form of Kod&#803;iya. But it is interesting to note that
        the further subdivision of the Vair&icirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;--the
        &#346;irik&acirc; bhatti (Srik&acirc; bhakti) which inscription No. 6
        mentions, is not known to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>. This is a gap
        such as may by be expected to occur in a list handed down by oral
        tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The Kot&#803;ika gan&#803;a is again mentioned in the badly mutilated
        inscription No. 19, plate xv. A complete restoration is impossible.
      </p>
      <div class="verse">
        <p>
          L. 1. <i>Sam&#775;valsare 90 va...sya kut&#803;ubani. vad&acirc;nasya

      </div>
      <p>
        It may, however, be inferred from the fragments of the first line that
        the dedication was made by a woman who was described as the wife (<i>kut&#803;umbin&icirc;</i>)
        of one person and as the daughter-in-law (<i>vadhu</i>) of another. The
        first part of line 2, restored as above gives--"in the congregation of
        ... out of the Kot&#803;iya school, the Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hanaka line
        and the Majham&acirc; branch...." The restoration of the two names Kot&#803;iya
        and Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hanaka seems to me absolutely certain, because
        they exactly fill the blanks in the inscription, and because the
        information in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> (S. B. E. vol. XXII, p. 293)
        regarding the Madhyam&acirc;&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc; points in that
        direction. The latter work tells us that Priyagantha, the second pupil
        of Susthita and Supratibuddha, founded a &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;, called
        Madhyam&acirc; or Majhim&acirc;.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our inscriptions show that Professor Jacobi's explanation of the
        terms <i>gan&#803;a, kula</i> and <i>&#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;</i> [<a
        href="#b1_fn48" id="b1_fm48_">48</a>] is correct and that the first
        denotes the school, the second the line of teachers, and the third a
        branch which separated from such a line, it follows that the &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;s
        named in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> without the mention of a <i>gan&#803;a</i>
        and <i>kula</i>, must belong to the last preceding <i>gan&#803;a</i> and
        derive their origin from one of its <i>kulas</i>. Hence the Madhyam&acirc;
        &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc; doubtless was included in the Kaut&#803;ika gan&#803;a,
        and an offshoot of one of its <i>kulas</i>, the fourth of which is
        called Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hanaka or Pan&#803;hav&acirc;han&#803;aya. The
        correctness of these inferences is proved by R&acirc;ja&#347;ckhara's
        statement regarding his spiritual descent at the end of the <i>Prabandha
        kosha</i>, which he composed in Vik. sam&#775; 1405. He informs us that
        he belonged to the Kot&#803;ika gan&#803;a, the Pra&#347;nav&acirc;hana
        kula, the Madhyam&acirc; &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;, the Harshapur&icirc;ya
        gachha and the Maladh&acirc;ri samt&acirc;na, founded by the illustrious
        Abhayas&ucirc;ri.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last words of l. 2 I do not dare to propose an emendation; I
        merely note that the gift seems to have consisted of pillars, <i>thab&acirc;ni</i>,
        i. e. <i>stambh&acirc;h[postvocalic]</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The Kot&#803;iya gan&#803;a seems finally to be mentioned in pl.
        xiii, No. 2, where the copy of line 1, 2nd side may be corrected as,--
      </p>

      5. Names of an older <i>gan&#803;a</i> and of one of its <i>kulas</i>
      occur in No. 10 plate xiv, where the copy, which is faulty, may allow the
      following partial restoration,---

          the V&acirc;ran&#803;a school."
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <i>Varane</i> must be a mistake for the very similar word <i>Ch&acirc;rane</i>.
        The second <i>kula</i> of this <i>gan&#803;a</i> which, according to the
        <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i> (<i>S.B.E</i>. vol. XXII, p. 291) was founded by
        &#346;r&icirc;gupta, the fifth pupil of &Acirc;rya Suhastin, is the Pr&icirc;tidharmika
        (p. 292). It is easy to see that a similar name is hidden in the
        compound <i>Petivamikakutav&acirc;chakasya</i> 'of the preacher of the
        Petiv&acirc;mika line'; and an inscription excavated by Dr. Fuhrer at
        Mathur&acirc; mentions the Petiv&acirc;mika (<i>kula</i>) of the V&acirc;rana
        <i>gan&#803;a</i>. With the second line little can be done: if the
        letters <i>prap&acirc;</i> are correct and form a word, one of the
        objects dedicated must have been a drinking fountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. The inscription No. 20, plate xv offers likewise slightly corrupt and
        mutilated names of a <i>gan&#803;a</i>, a <i>kula</i> and a <i>s&acirc;kh&acirc;</i>,
        mentioned in the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>. In the lithographed copy lines
        3-7 are hopeless and there is no rubbing to help. The word <i>thitu</i>
        'of a daughter' in line 6, and the following <i>ma.uya</i> which is
        probably a misreading of <i>m&acirc;tuye</i> 'of the mother' show that
        this dedication also was made by a female. The last four syllables <i>vato
        maho</i> are probably the remnant of another namask&acirc;ra--<i>namo
        bhagavato Mah&acirc;v&icirc;rasya.</i> As regards the proper names,
        Aryya Rehiniya is an impossible form; but on comparison with the next
        inscription to be mentioned, it is evident that the stone must have read
        <i> Aryvodchikiy&acirc;to</i> or <i>Aryyadehikiy&acirc;to g>n&#803;&acirc;[to]
        </i>. [<a href="#b1_fn49" id="b1_fm49_">49</a>] According to the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        (<i>S.B.E</i>. vol. XXII, p. 291) &Acirc;rya-Rohan&#803;a was the first
        pupil of &Acirc;rya Suhastin and founded the Uddeha gan&#803;a. The
        latter split up into four &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;s and into six kulas.
        The name of its fourth &#347;&acirc;kh&acirc;, P&ucirc;rn&#803;apatrik&acirc;,
        closely resembles--especially in its consonantal elements--that of the
        inscription, <i>Petaputrik&acirc;</i>, and I do not hesitate in
        correcting the latter to <i>Ponapatrik&acirc;</i> which would be the
        equivalent of Sansk. Paurn&#803;apatrik&acirc;. Among the six kulas is
        the Parih&acirc;saka, and considering the other agreements, I believe it
        probable that the mutilated name read as <i>Puridha.ka</i> is a
        misreading of <i>Parih&acirc;ka</i>, We may emend the first two times

        These and many other statements in the inscriptions, about the teachers
        and their schools are of no small importance in themselves for the early
        history of the Jainas. The agreement of the above with the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>
        can best be shown by placing the statements in question against one
        another. The inscriptions prove the actual existence of twenty of the
        subdivisions mentioned in the Sthavir&acirc;vali of the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra</i>.

        four--the Uddchika, V&acirc;ran&#803;a, Ve&#347;av&acirc;d&#803;iya(?)
        and Kod&#803;iya.

          belong only to the south, and the <i>&#346;vet&acirc;mbaras</i> to the
          north. This is by no means the case. The former in the Panj&acirc;b,
          in eastern R&acirc;jput&acirc;na and in the North West Provinces, are
          just as numerous, if not more so, than the latter, and also appear

          lower rank, now called Pan&#803;d&#803;it, now-a-days wear the costume
          of the country. The Bhat&#803;t&#803;&acirc;raka, the heads of the
          sect, usually wrap themselves in a large cloth (<i>chadr</i>). They
          lay it off during meals. A disciple then rings a bell as a sign that
          entrance is forbidden (<i>Ind. Ant.</i> loc. cit.). When the present
          custom first arose cannot be ascertained. From the description of the
          Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang (St. Julien, <i>Vie.</i> p. 224), who
          calls them Li-hi, it appears that they were still faithful to their
          principles in the beginning of the seventh century A.D. "The Li-hi
          (Nirgranthis) distinguish themselves by leaving their bodies naked and
          pulling out their hair. Their skin is all cracked, their feet are hard
          and chapped: like rotting trees that one sees near rivers."

          stereotyped introductions to the sermons of Jina it is always pointed
          out that they are addressed to the Aryan and non-Aryan. Thus in the <i>Aupap&acirc;tika
          S&ucirc;tra</i> &sect; 56. (Leumann) it runs as follows: <i>tesim&#775;
          savvesim&#775; &acirc;r&#803;iyaman&acirc;riyanam&#775; agil&acirc;e
          dhammatm&#775; &acirc;ikkhai</i> "to all these, Aryans and non-Aryans,
          he taught the law untiringly". In accordance with this principle,
          conversions of people of low caste, such as gardeners, dyers, etc.,
          are not uncommon even at the present day. Muhammadans too, regarded as
          Mlechcha, are still received among the Jaina communities. Some cases
          of the kind were communicated to me in Ah[postvocalic]mad&acirc;b&acirc;d
          in the year 1876, as great triumphs of the Jainas. Tales of the
          conversion of the emperor Akbar, through the patriarch H&icirc;ravijaya
          (<i>Ind. Antiq.</i> Vol. XI, p. 256), and of the spread of the
          Digambara sect in an island Jainabhadri, in the Indian Ocean (<i>Ind.
          Ant.</i> Vol. VII, p. 28) and in Arabia, shew that the Jainas are
          familiar with the idea of the conversion of non-Indians. Hiuen
          Tsiang's note on the appearance of the Nirgrantha or Digambara in
          Kiapishi (Beal, <i>Si-yu-ki</i>, Vol. I, p. 55), points apparently to
          the fact that they had, in the North West at least, spread their
          missionary activity beyond the borders of India.

          (Sacred Books of the East</i>, Vol. XXII, p. 88-186) contain
          directions for nuns. It seems, however, that they have never played
          such an important part as in Buddhism. At the present time, the few
          female orders among the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara consist entirely of
          virgin widows, whose husbands have died in childhood, before the
          beginning of their life together. It is not necessary to look upon the
          admission of nuns among the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara as an imitation of
          Buddhist teaching, as women were received into some of the old
          Brahmanical orders; see my note to <i>Manu</i>, VIII, 363, (<i>Sac.
          Bks. of the East</i>, Vol. XXV, p. 317). Among the Digambaras,
          exclusion of women was demanded from causes not far to seek. They give
          as their reason for it, the doctrine that women are not capable of
          attaining <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>; see Peterson, <i>Second Report</i>,

          olden times, to describe those saved during their lifetimes and used
          in the &#346;aivite doctrine to describe a consecrated one who is on
          the way to redemption. An Arhat, among the Br&acirc;hman&#803;s, is a

          &Acirc;pastamba, <i>Dharmas&ucirc;tra.</i> I, 13, 13; II, 10, I.) and
          this idea is so near that of the Buddhists and the Jainas that it may
          well be looked upon as the foundation of the latter. The meaning of T&icirc;rthakara

          <a href="#b1_fm20" id="b1_fn20_"><b>Footnote 20</b></a>: Apart from
          the ill-supported supposition of Colebrooke, Stevenson and Thomas,
          according to which Buddha was a disloyal disciple of the founder of
          the Jainas, there is the view held by H. H. Wilson, A. Weber, and
          Lassen, and generally accepted till twenty-five years ago, that the
          Jainas are an old sect of the Buddhists. This was based, on the one
          hand, upon the resemblance of the Jaina doctrines, writings, and
          traditions to those of the Buddhists, on the other, on the fact that
          the canonical works of the Jainas show a more modern dialect than
          those of the Buddhists, and that authentic historical proofs of their
          early existence are wanting. I was myself formerly persuaded of the
          correctness of this view and even thought I recognised the Jainas in
          the Buddhist school of the Sammat&icirc;ya. On a more particular
          examination of Jaina literature, to which I was forced on account of
          the collection undertaken for the English Government in the seventies,
          I found that the Jainas had changed their name and were always, in
          more ancient times, called Nirgrantha or Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha. The
          observation that the Buddhists recognise the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha and
          relate of their head and founder, that he was a rival of Buddha's and
          died at P&acirc;v&acirc; where the last T&icirc;rthakara is said to
          have attained <i>Nirv&acirc;n&#803;a</i>, caused me to accept the view
          that the Jainas and the Buddhists sprang from the same religious
          movement. My supposition was confirmed by Jacobi, who reached the like
          view by another course, independently of mine (see <i>Zeitschrift der
          Deutsch Morg. Ges</i>. Bd. XXXV, S. 669. Note 1), pointing out that
          the last T&icirc;rthakara in the Jaina canon bears the same name as
          among the Buddhists. Since the publication of our results in the <i>Ind.
          Ant</i>. Vol. VII, p. 143 and in Jacobi's introduction to his edition
          of the <i>Kalpas&ucirc;tra,</i> which have been further verified by
          Jacobi with great penetration, views on this question have been
          divided. Oldenberg, Kern, Hoernle, and others have accepted this new
          view without hesitation, while A Weber (<i>Indische Studien</i> Bd.
          XVI, S. 240) and Barth (<i>Revue de l'Histoire des Religions</i>, tom.
          III, p. 90) keep to their former standpoint. The latter do not trust
          the Jaina tradition and believe it probable that the statements in the
          same are falsified. There are certainly great difficulties in the way
          of accepting such a position especially the improbability that the
          Buddhists should have forgotten the fact of the defection of their
          hated enemy. Meanwhile, this is not absolutely impossible as the
          oldest preserved Jaina canon had its first authentic edition only in
          the fifth or sixth century of our era, and as yet the proof is wanting
          that the Jainas, in ancient times, possessed a fixed tradition. The
          belief that I am able to insert this missing link in the chain of
          argument and the hope of removing the doubts of my two honoured
          friends has caused me to attempt a connected statement of the whole
          question although this necessitates the repetition of much that has
          already been said, and is in the first part almost entirely a
          recapitulation of the results of Jacobi's researches.

          Bd. XXXIV, S. 749. Its significance in connection with the Jaina
          tradition as to their schisms has been overlooked until now. It has
          also been unnoticed that the assertion, that Vardham&acirc;na died
          during Buddha's lifetime, proves that the latest account of this
          occurrence given by traditions 467 B.C. is false: Later Buddhist
          legends (Spence Hardy, <i>Manual of Budhism</i>, pp. 266-271) treat of
          N&acirc;taputta's death in more detail. In a lengthy account they give
          as the cause of the same the apostacy of one of his disciples, Up&acirc;li
          who was converted by Buddha. After going over to Buddhism, Up&acirc;li
          treated his former master with scorn, and presumed to relate a parable
          which should prove the foolishness of those who believed in false
          doctrines. Thereupon the Nigan&#803;t&#803;ha fell into despair. He
          declared his alms-vessel was broken, his existence destroyed, went to
          P&acirc;va, and died there. Naturally no importance is to be given to
          this account and its details. They are apparently the outcome of
          sect-hatred.

          of these inscriptions, which were formerly believed to be Buddhist,
          was first made clear by Dr. Bhangv&acirc;nl&acirc;l's Indr&acirc;ji's
          careful discussion in the <i>Actes du Vli&egrave;me Congr&egrave;s
          Internat. des Orientalistes</i> Sect. Ary. pp. 135-159. H; first
          recognised the true names of the King Kh&acirc;ravela and his
          predecessors and shewed that Kh&acirc;ravela and his wife were patrons
          of the Jainas. We have to thank him for the information that the
          inscription contains a date in the Maurya Era. I have thoroughly
          discussed his excellent article in the <i>Oesterreichischen
          Monatsschrift</i>, Bd. X, S. 231 ff. and have there given my reasons
          for differing from him on an important point, namely, the date of the
          beginning of the Maurya Era, which, according to his view begins with
          the conquest of Kalin&#775;ga by A&#347;oka about 255 B. C. Even yet I
          find it impossible to accept that the expression, "in the hundred and
          sixty fifth year of the era of the Maurya Kings", can mean anything
          else than that 164 years have passed between the thirteenth year of
          the rule of Kh&acirc;ravela and the anointing of the first Maurya King
          Chandrugupta. Unfortunately it is impossible to fix the year of the
          latter occurrence, or to say more than that it took place between the
          years 322 and 312 B.C. The date given in Kh&acirc;ravela's inscription
          cannot therefore be more closely fixed than that it lies between 156
          and 147 B.C. I now add to my former remarks--that appeals to the Arhat
          and Siddha appear also in Jaina inscriptions from Mathur&acirc; and
          may be taken as a certain mark of the sect. Thus it is worthy of note
          that even in Hiuen Tsiang's time, (Beal, <i>Si-yu-ki</i>, Vol. II, p.
          205) Kalinga was one of the chief seats of the Jainas.

        The mythology of the Jainas, whilst including many of the Hindu
        divinities, to which it accords very inferior positions, is altogether
        different in composition. It has all the appearance of a purely
        constructed system. The gods are classified and subdivided into orders,
        genera, and species; all are mortal, have their ages fixed, as well as
        their abodes, and are mostly distinguished by cognizances <i>chihnas</i>
        or <i>l&acirc;&#324;chhan&#803;as</i>. Their T&icirc;rthakaras, T&igrave;rthamkaras,
        or perfected saints, are usually known as twenty-four belonging to the
        present age. But the mythology takes account also of a past and a future
        age or renovation of the world, and to each of these aeons are assigned
        twenty-four T&icirc;rthakaras. But this is not all: in their cosmogony
        they lay down other continents besides Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa-Bharata or
        that which we dwell in. These are separated from Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa
        by impassable seas, but exactly like it in every respect and are called
        Dh&acirc;tuki-kanda and Pushkar&acirc;rddha; and of each of these there
        are eastern, and western Bharata and Air&agrave;vata regions, whilst of
        Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa there is also a Bharata and an Air&acirc;vata
        region: these make the following ten regions or worlds:--

        To each of these is allotted twenty four past, present and future At&icirc;ts
        or Jinas,--making in all 720 of this class, for which they have invented
        names: but they are only names. [<a href="#b2_fn1" id="b2_fm1_">1</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the T&icirc;rthakaras of the present age or <i>avasarpini</i> in the
        Bharata-varsha of Jamb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa, however, we are supplied with
        minute details:--their names, parents, stations, reputed ages,
        complexions, attendants, cognizances (<i>chihna</i>) or characteristics,
        etc. and these details are useful for the explanation of the iconography
        we meet with in the shrines of Jaina temples. There the images of the T&icirc;rthakaras
        are placed on highly sculptured thrones and surrounded by other smaller
        attendant figures. In temples of the &#346;vet&acirc;mbara sect the
        images are generally of marble--white in most cases, but often black for
        images of the 19th, 2Oth, 22nd and 23rd Jinas. On the front of the
        throne or <i>&acirc;sana</i> are usually carved three small figures: at
        the proper right of the Jina is a male figure representing the Yaksha
        attendant or servant of that particular Jina; at the left end of the
        throne is the corresponding female--or Yakshin&icirc;, Yaksh&icirc; or
        &#346;&acirc;sanadev&icirc;; whilst in a panel in the middle there is
        often another dev&icirc;. At the base of the seat also, are placed nine
        very small figures representing the <i>navagraha</i> or nine planets;
        that is the sun, moon, five planets, and ascending and descending nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Jaina <i>Pur&acirc;nas</i>, legends are given to account for the
        connexion of the Yakshas and Yaksh&icirc;s with their respective T&icirc;rthakaras:
        thus, in the case of P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha, we have a story of
        two brothers Marubh&ucirc;ti and Kamat&#803;ha, who in eight successive
        incarnations were always enemies, and were finally born as P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha
        and Sambaradeva respectively. A P&acirc;shan&#803;d&#803;a or
        unbeliever, engaged in the <i>panch&acirc;gni</i> rite, when felling a
        tree for his fire, against the remonstrance of P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha,
        cut in pieces two snakes that were in it; the Jina, however restored
        them to life by means of the <i>pa&ntilde;chamantra</i>. They were then
        re-born in P&acirc;t&acirc;la-loka as Dharan&#803;endra or N&acirc;gendra-Yaksha
        and Padm&acirc;vat&icirc;-Yakshin&#803;&icirc;. When Sambaradeva or
        Meghakum&acirc;ra afterwards attacked the Arbat with a great storm,
        whilst he was engaged in the <i>K&acirc;yotsarga</i> austerity--standing
        immovable, exposed to the weather--much in the way that M&acirc;ra
        attacked &#346;&acirc;kya Buddha at Bodh-gay&acirc;, Dharan&#803;endra's
        throne in P&acirc;t&acirc;la thereupon shook, and the N&acirc;ga or
        Yaksha with his consort at once sped to the protection of his former
        benefactor. Dharan&#803;endra spread his many hoods over the head of the
        Arhata and the Yakshn&#775;&icirc; Padm&acirc;vat&icirc; held a white
        umbrella (<i>&#347;veta chhatri</i>) over him for protection. Ever after
        they became his constant attendants, just as &#346;akra was to Buddha.
        The legend is often represented in old-sculptures, in the cave-temples
        at B&acirc;d&acirc;mi, Elura, etc., and the figure of P&acirc;r&#347;va
        is generally carved with the snake-hoods (<i>&#346;eshaphan&#803;i</i>)
        over him. [<a href="#b2_fn2" id="b2_fm2_">2</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Other legends account for the attachment of each pair of &#346;&acirc;sanadevat&acirc;s
        to their respective Jinas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras and Digambaras agree generally in the details
        respecting the different T&icirc;rthakaras; but, from information
        furnished from Maisur, they seem to differ as to the names of the
        Yakshin&#803;is attached to the several T&icirc;rthakaras, except the
        first and last two; they differ also in the names of several of the
        Jinas of the past and the future aeons. The Digambaras enlist most of
        the sixteen Vidy&acirc;devis or goddesses of knowledge among the Yakshin&#803;&icirc;s,
        whilst the other sect include scarcely a third of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Vidy&acirc;dev&icirc;s, as given by Hemachandra, are--(1) Rohin&#803;&icirc;;
        (2) Praj&ntilde;apt&icirc;; (3) Vajrasr&#803;i&#324;khal&acirc;; (4)
        Kuli&#347;&acirc;nku&#347;c&acirc;--probably the Anku&#347;a-Yaksh&icirc;
        of the &#346;vet&agrave;mb&acirc;ra fourteenth Jina; (5) Chakre&#347;var&icirc;;
        (6) Naradatt&acirc; or Purushadatt&acirc;; (7) K&acirc;li or K&acirc;l&icirc;k&acirc;;
        (8) Mah&aacute;k&acirc;l&icirc;; (9) Gaur&icirc;; (10) G&acirc;ndh&acirc;r&icirc;;
        (11) Sarv&acirc;stramah&acirc;jv&acirc;l&acirc;; (12) M&acirc;nav&icirc;;
        (13) Vairot&#803;y&acirc;; (14) Achchhupt&acirc;; (15) M&acirc;nas&icirc;;
        and (16) Mah&acirc;m&acirc;nasik&acirc;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The images of the T&icirc;rthakaras are always represented seated with
        their legs crossed in front--the toes of one foot resting close upon the
        knee of the other; and the right hand lies over the left in the lap. All
        are represented exactly alike except that P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha,
        the twenty-third, has the snake-hoods over him; and, with the
        Digambaras, Sup&acirc;r&#347;va--the seventh, has also a smaller group
        of snake hoods. The Digambara images are all quite nude; those of the
        &#346;vet&acirc;mbaras are represented as clothed, and they decorate
        them with crowns and ornaments. They are distinguished from one another
        by their attendant <i>Yakshas</i> and <i>Yakshin&#803;&icirc;s</i> as
        well as by their respective <i>chihnas</i> or cognizances which are
        carved on the cushion of the throne.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Jinas are ascribed to the Ikshv&acirc;ku family (<i>kula</i>)except
        the twentieth Munisuvrata and twenty-second Nemin&acirc;tha, who were of
        the Harivam&#803;&#347;a race.
      </p>
      <p>
        All received <i>d&icirc;ksh&agrave;</i> or consecration at their native
        places; and all obtained <i>j&#324;&acirc;na</i> or complete
        enlightenment at the same, except R&#803;ishabha who became a <i>Kevalin</i>
        at Purimat&agrave;la, Nemi at Girn&acirc;r, and Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra at
        the Rijup&agrave;luk&agrave; river; and twenty of them died or obtained
        <i>moksha</i> (deliverance in bliss) on Sameta-&#346;ikhara or Mount P&acirc;r&#347;van&acirc;tha
        in the west of Bengal. But R&#803;ishabha, the first, died on Asht&#803;&acirc;pada--supposed
        to be &#346;atru&ntilde;ljaya in Gujar&acirc;t; V&acirc;sup&ucirc;jya
        died at Champ&acirc;puri in north Bengal; Nemin&acirc;tha on mount Girn&acirc;r;
        and Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, the last, at P&acirc;v&acirc;pur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty-one of the T&icirc;rthakaras are said to have attained Moksha in
        the K&acirc;yotsarga (Guj. <i>K&acirc;&uuml;sagga</i>) posture, and R&#803;ishabha,
        Nemi, and Mah&acirc;vira on the <i>padm&acirc;sana</i> or lotus throne.

        emancipated from all concern, they can have no interest in mundane
        affairs. They and such beings as are supposed to have reached perfection

      <div class="verse">
        I. Bhavan&acirc;dhipatis, Bhavanav&acirc;sins or Bhaumeyikas, of which

        born in the regions above the Kalpas.

          Graiveyakas, living on the upper part of the universe; and (b) the
          Anuttaras or those above whom there are no others.

          in the fifth or highest--the great Vim&acirc;na called Sarv&acirc;rthasiddha--they
          all live thirty-three S&acirc;garopamas or periods of unimagiable

            people of the greatest, smallest and middle size; [<a href="#b2_fn8"
            id="b2_fm8_">8</a>] on high places, underground, on the surface of

            reside the blessed perfected souls, rid of all transmigration, and
            arrived at the excellent state of perfection. The dimension of a
            perfected soul is two-thirds of the height which the individual had
            in his last existence.
